### YouTube Integration

Bring YouTube into [Shortcut](https://www.shortcut.com/) with this link preview integration. Users can paste videos from YouTube to see real-time videos in markdown editors, including comments. The YouTube Integration requires no set up - it should work out of the box with any shareable link from YouTube.

### With this integration you will be able to: <a href="#h_01hzfbfw7py9psbehks3qdy6az" id="h_01hzfbfw7py9psbehks3qdy6az"></a>

* Embed YouTube videos in Shortcut stories, comments, Epics, Objectives, Iterations, and Docs

### Use Cases <a href="#h_01hzfbfp1d7e7b94ssh6pmqtnw" id="h_01hzfbfp1d7e7b94ssh6pmqtnw"></a>

* Planning:
  * Better support of planning - providing video embeds would keep product and engineering planning + work in sync
* Are you using Shortcut Docs for technical documentation? Maybe you want to be able to add explainer videos.
