# Loom Integration

### Loom Integration

Bring Loom into Shortcut with this link preview integration. Users can paste videos from Loom to see real-time previews in markdown editors, including comments, to help explain complex ideas with pre-recorded video messages. The Loom Integration requires no set up - it should work out of the box with any shareable link from Loom.

### With this integration you will be able to: <a href="#h_01hzk9wwxssjb8ycx9y6x9x1rx" id="h_01hzk9wwxssjb8ycx9y6x9x1rx"></a>

* Embed Loom videos in Shortcut stories, comments and Docs
* Explain complex ideas with pre-recorded video messages
* Provide detailed explanations about design feedback

### Use Cases <a href="#h_01hzfbfp1d7e7b94ssh6pmqtnw" id="h_01hzfbfp1d7e7b94ssh6pmqtnw"></a>

* Planning:
  * Better support of planning - providing video embeds would keep product and engineering planning + work in sync
* Communication:
  * Improve the speed at which issues are looked at by showing
* Are you using Shortcut Docs for technical documentation? Maybe you want to be able to add explainer videos.
