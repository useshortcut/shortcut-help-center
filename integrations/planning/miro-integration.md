The Shortcut and Miro integration helps organizations connect ideation and planning in Miro with the work being done in Shortcut. Embed a Miro board anywhere you can leave a comment or type in Shorcut - Stories, Epics, Milestone descriptions, comments, and Docs. When users drop Miro links in Shorctut, users in the organization will be able to see previews and collaborate on Miro boards directly from Shortcut.

### What the Miro <> Shortcut Integration does... <a href="#h_01hzfcjfev3zzyepjeab9vqp8y" id="h_01hzfcjfev3zzyepjeab9vqp8y"></a>

Connect Miro into Shortcut with real-time previews of boards and enable your team to collaborate on a Miro board directly in Shortcut. Here's what users will be able to do:&#x20;

1. Drop links and get real-time previews of Miro boards in Shortcut on:&#x20;
   1. Story descriptions and comments
   2. Epic descriptions and comments
   3. Objective descriptions
   4. Iteration descriptions
   5. Docs
   6. Project descriptions (if applicable to your Workspace)
2. &#x20;Update Miro boards from any preview link in Shortcut for seamless collaboration

**There are two types of embeds:**

* Public boards - Anyone can view the link in Shortcut
* Private boards - Shared with team

### See it in action:  <a href="#h_01hzfcjfevvndxbvke27pd7tm7" id="h_01hzfcjfevvndxbvke27pd7tm7"></a>

In this demo, we see a link to a Miro board being dropped into the description of a Shortcut Epic. Once a link is dropped in, users see a live preview of the Miro board. You'll notice that the preview allows you to see real-time updates happening in Miro. You can also see that the user in Shortcut is able to update the board directly from Shortcut.
