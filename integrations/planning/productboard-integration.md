### Productboard Integration

![](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/15059267871380)

Connect your planning efforts in Productboard to your [Shortcut](https://www.shortcut.com/) development efforts in one cohesive system. Our current integration offers the following:

* Ability to push a Productboard feature into Shortcut as a new Epic so you can turn ideas into planned work.
* Sync and display the status of the Shortcut Epic within Productboard so your Product Team can gauge progress on their roadmap.
* Provide quick access links between the Shortcut Epic and Productboard Feature so your developers understand the context of their work.

The Shortcut Integration on Productboard is only available to customers that are on a Pro, Scale, or Enterprise plan. Please contact Productboard Support for more information regarding their pricing and plan structure.

The Productboard API token is associated with a specific Productboard user, not the Productboard Workspace or Integration. In Productboard, the user may choose to revoke this key, or it may be revoked if that Productboard user's account is disabled. If that happens, the Integration will be automatically disabled the next time Shortcut tries to use the API key. You can re-enable a disabled Integration by going to [the Integrations -> Productboard page](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/integrations/productboard) in Shortcut and entering a new API key.

A Shortcut Task will automatically appear on all Productboard features. However, you must add it from the Task menu for it to appear as a column in your feature view.

Click on the “Shortcut” button to push a Productboard Feature into Shortcut as a new Epic.

Selecting the Epic link option in Productboard will open a new browser tab or window for that Epic in Shortcut.

The Shortcut Epic has the same name and description as the Productboard Epic. It also includes a link back to the original Productboard feature.

Within Productboard, the “Shortcut” column is now populated with the Shortcut Epic status, which is updated automatically as your Epic progresses. Clicking on the status will take you directly to the Shortcut Epic.

Our current integration does not support pushing a Productboard feature to an _existing_ Shortcut Epic, or pushing it as a Shortcut Story or Objective. To support this functionality in the future, and request additional features down the road, please [send your feedback](mailto:support@productboard.com) to the Productboard team.
