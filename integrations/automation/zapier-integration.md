You'll be able to format your created Stories however you want. Story Name and Workflow are the only required fields but you may also choose to specify Teams, Epics, add a description and choose story type, etc.&#x20;

Once completed, you will be prompted to **Test & Continue** the Zap.

This test should have successfully created a story via Zapier. Go on check it out on Shortcut!

Lastly, we now need to turn on this zap so that this happens automatically. Simply click on **Retest & Continue** after the test has been performed:
