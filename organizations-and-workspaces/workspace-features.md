Automations do the busy work so you can focus on the work you love.

A Team in Shortcut represents a cross-functional squad, or any other group of users who work on projects together, or in Shortcut terms, users that collectively own Stories, Epics, and Iterations.

From [the Teams Settings page](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/teams?stories_group_by=workflow_state_id\&stories_sort_by=priority), you'll be able to Create a new Team, see a quick view of Progress and associated Team members, and search for/access any Active or Archived Teams' detail pages.&#x20;

Labels are a way to associate [Stories](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016199771) and [Epics](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017524632).

Custom Fields are a part of the evolution of our [Data Model](https://shortcut.com/blog/previewing-our-streamlined-data-model) that elevates the Shortcut experience for more structure, organization, and flexibility.&#x20;

From [this Custom Fields Settings page](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/fields), Admins can adjust the values of Shortcut defined field values and colors, our Advanced Custom Fields, while similar to our standard Custom Fields, allow for the customization of the title, description, icon, and values to fit your Team's workflow.

A Workflow is the process through which Stories move, from creation to completion. Workflows are set by you and can be customized to be as simple or as complicated as you want.

From [the Workflow Settings page](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/workflows), an Admin will be able to Create new Workflows (if applicable to your Organization's subscription plan), Manage existing Workflows and Team associations, and quickly access respective Stories page views for each Workflow.

For more details on the features and functionality of this Settings page, please review the respective Help Center documentation for [Managing Your Workflows](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016617052-Managing-Your-Workflows).

### Workflow States <a href="#h_01jbf93y81wzfc4dxdwj0j7kzw" id="h_01jbf93y81wzfc4dxdwj0j7kzw"></a>

Workflow States are how Stories are essential groupings of Stories that have a certain status within a Workflow. A Workspace comes with 5 default Workflow States that fall into the 4 Workflow State types (Backlog, Unstarted, Started, and Done). You can keep these default Workflow States as is, edit them, or delete them and add your own -- it’s up to you.

From [this Workflow States Settings page](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/workflow), an Admin can create new Workflow States, manage existing Workflow States, identify the "Default State", toggle Auto-assign Owner, and quickly access an Advanced Search page for all the Stories associated with a specific State. Additionally, Epic States can also be managed by selecting the Epics tab. More on these below.

For more details on the features and functionality of this Settings page, please review the respective Help Center documentation for [Managing Your Workflow States](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/205268889-Managing-Your-Workflow-States).

**Epic Workflow States**

From the Epics tab on this Workflow States Settings page, an Admin can customize the parent states (Unstarted, Started, and Done) to contain additional child states that may help further granulate the way Epics are categorized in the Workspace. Similar functionality exists on this page in terms of the creation of new States and the management of existing States.

For more details on the features and functionality of this Settings page, please review the respective Help Center documentation for [Epic Workflow States](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046059412-Epic-Workflow-States).

### Work In Progress Limits (currently in Early Access; not available to GA just yet!) <a href="#h_01jbf93y81xmkz28q45b4f9qqm" id="h_01jbf93y81xmkz28q45b4f9qqm"></a>

WIP (Work-In-Progress) Limits help Agile development teams maintain focus and efficiency by setting a recommended limit to the amount of work in progress to prevent bottlenecks and ensure Stories are completed before picking up new ones.

From [this Work in Progress Limits Settings page](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/wip-limits), an Admin can select a Team to view and edit limits for any associated Workflows by State.

For more details on the features and functionality of this Settings page, please review the respective Help Center documentation for Work in Progress (WIP) Limits.

### Estimate Scale <a href="#h_01jbf93y81zdfs5ja77z5q6zy9" id="h_01jbf93y81zdfs5ja77z5q6zy9"></a>

Shortcut offers several graphs and reports that you can use to visualize your Workspace’s productivity. You can express whether you want to track progress in Estimate Points or Story Count by selecting from the **Show Progress and Metrics Using** dropdown.

#### Setting your Workspace's Points Estimate Scale <a href="#h_01hhqnzzqykv7f6814hb195f93" id="h_01hhqnzzqykv7f6814hb195f93"></a>

Story point estimations can be an important part of a Workspace's agile development methodology. However, no two teams handle estimations exactly the same. Shortcut gives you the option to customize your estimate scale in the **Settings > Estimate Scale**. Stories can also be set as "Unestimated", which is the default for new Stories.\

### Story Templates <a href="#h_01jbf93y81rvnayg4rby58x86c" id="h_01jbf93y81rvnayg4rby58x86c"></a>

Story Templates allow you to create Stories from a pre-formatted template, saving you and your team time and effort on commonly written Stories.
