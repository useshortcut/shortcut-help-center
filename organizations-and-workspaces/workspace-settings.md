Within the Settings of your Workspace, prepare your team for success by building the foundation and setting the appropriate information. True to our values, use this space to bring a bit of Joy with custom settings! From here, you'll be able to access:

* User Directory
* Invite New Users
* Import and Sync Data
* General Settings
* Billing
* Loading Icons

### User Directory <a href="#h_01jbf5k4qht89zqtr656nyce9m" id="h_01jbf5k4qht89zqtr656nyce9m"></a>

If you're an Owner or Admin and wish to view the Users within the Workspace (Active, Inactive, and Imported Users), the [User Directory](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/users) is a good starting point.

From this page, you can change someone's role in your Workspace by using the drop-down next to the person's name. You can also deactivate a user from this User Directory page as well.&#x20;

For more information on using the User Directory within a Workspace, you can find additional details in the Help Center article for [Managing User Roles](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033599771-Managing-User-Roles).

### Invite New Users <a href="#h_01jbf5sm4e1nxfakjc3c0wyc9t" id="h_01jbf5sm4e1nxfakjc3c0wyc9t"></a>

From this [Invite New Users](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/users/invite) Workspace Settings page, Owners and Admins have the ability to:

* Invite new Users via Email

### &#x20;Import and Sync Data <a href="#h_01jbf6ycz8q3awtnq6tx1pxnqc" id="h_01jbf6ycz8q3awtnq6tx1pxnqc"></a>

As seen in the image, there are several options for bringing data into Shortcut. Currently available is our Pivotal Tracker Importer script, Jira Sync, Auto-Import (specifically for Jira and Trello currently), and our CSV Importer (Shortcut Support assisted currently).

For more information on Importing data into Shortcut, please review the Importing Data section in our Shortcut Help Center documentation for [Importing and Exporting Shortcut Data](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044295392-Importing-and-Exporting-Shortcut-Data#h_01HMYGFA4EYAFM6B81AG66THZ5).

### General Settings <a href="#h_01jbf75ptkvs97cppt0hh4djas" id="h_01jbf75ptkvs97cppt0hh4djas"></a>

General Settings is the area where an Admin can adjust a variety of Settings for a Workspace (i.e. the Name, Location, UTC Offset, Working Days and the Workspace Icon).

While the names and URLs of all Shortcut spaces are defined during the initial setup, we do allow you to change the name and website of your Workspace as you wish. &#x20;

You can update your Workspace name, website, location, and UTC offset by going to the settings gear wheel and then **Workspace Settings >  General Settings.**

Reports are rendered against the Workspace's UTC offset.

#### Working Days <a href="#h_01hhqnzzqxea2fmhwmb2h8n9ch" id="h_01hhqnzzqxea2fmhwmb2h8n9ch"></a>

Some teams don't work every day of the week so counting reporting on those off days is mostly unnecessary. Shortcut has a Workspace level setting that allows an Owner or Admin to set certain Working Days.

All calculations, metrics, and lines on the Burndown and ARC (Added/Remaining/Completed) Charts take Working Days into account to give you a more accurate representation of your work. The Default Working days are Monday through Friday, inclusive.

Currently, only the Burndown and ARC (Added/Remaining/Completed) Charts accounts for non-working days, but the rest of the charts will be updated soon.

#### Workspace Icon <a href="#h_01jbf61yn3bfq6y5t8tqfqs6xn" id="h_01jbf61yn3bfq6y5t8tqfqs6xn"></a>

You can customize your Workspace with your own icon or company logo by going to the settings gear wheel and then **Workspace Settings > General Settings** and uploading the icon. The icon must be 180px by 180px.

### Billing <a href="#h_01jbf5xr1sdz7xwby2ccd75rf0" id="h_01jbf5xr1sdz7xwby2ccd75rf0"></a>

From this [Billing Settings](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/billing) page, Owners and Admins will be able to adjust the Billing Related Details, the Plan type and frequency, update the Billing Contact, and access past Invoices.&#x20;

Additional details can be found in our Help Center documentation for [Managing Your Billing Details](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033231852-Managing-Your-Billing-Details).

### Loading Icons <a href="#h_01jbf5xv58qyayanhcaj06wway" id="h_01jbf5xv58qyayanhcaj06wway"></a>

While Shortcut comes with a default Shortcut logo loading icon, your Workspace may also wish to add a custom loading icon using your logo, mascot, or any other significant image.&#x20;

To do so, navigate to **Settings >** [**Loading Icons**](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/loading-icons)**.** There you can upload your image (we support JPG, PNG, and GIF formats) and set the loading message.&#x20;
