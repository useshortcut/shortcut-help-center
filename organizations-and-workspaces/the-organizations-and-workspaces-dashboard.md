# The Organizations and Workspaces Dashboard

The Organizations and Workspaces Dashboard provides an overview of all of the Shortcut Organizations associated with your user account. Under each Organization, you'll see its Workspaces. You can access this page by selecting the logo or icon in the top left corner, and then selecting **View All.**

![The Dashboard](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/17722410331028)

You'll also find information about each Workspace, such as: its status (active or disabled), if it is your default Workspace (or can be set as default), its Shortcut URL, your role, your primary email address for that Workspace, and when it was created. You can go to any Workspace from this page by clicking on the View Workspace button.

To change the order of the Organizations or Workspaces on this page, click and hold the crossed arrow icon in the upper right corners of the Organization or Workspace, and then drag and drop the Organization or Workspace into a new position.

If you are an Owner or an Admin of the Organization, you can manage its user membership and roles, disable its Workspaces, see the number of billable users and invitations, and other administrative tasks by clicking **Manage Organization and Workspace**.

**Notes on Owner & Admin Roles**:

* **Owner**: If you promote a user to Owner in an Organization with more than one Workspace, the user will be promoted as Owner to All Workspaces in the Organization (even if they were not previously invited to these Workspaces)
* **Admin**: Alternatively, if you promote a user to an Admin of a single Workspace in an Organization, they are only an Admin of that Workspace.
* &#x20;

You can also add a new Workspace to an existing Organization (if you're an Owner or Admin of that Organization) or create an entirely new Organization.  To add a Workspace under an existing Organization, by selecting **Add Workspace to Organization**.

**Note**

Free plan accounts only have access to one (1) Workspace for the entire organization. For access to additional Workspaces, please consider [upgrading to a paid plan](https://app.clubhouse.io/settings/billing).

To create an entirely new Organization, click **Add New Organization** at the top of the page.

### **Managing User Roles** <a href="#h_01hd264mhm6wdfbcxmsxbks205" id="h_01hd264mhm6wdfbcxmsxbks205"></a>

The Manage Organization and Workspaces Dashboard allows you manage user membership and user roles across all Workspaces.

Users can be members of only one Workspace, all Workspaces, or any combination of Workspaces that suit your Organization's needs. A user can also have different roles in different Workspaces; for instance, a user might be an Admin of Workspace A, be a Member in Workspace B, and need only Observer access to Workspace C.

Note: The only exception to this rule is the Owner role -- an Owner of an Organization will also own all the Workspaces in it. Downgrading an Owner to another role in one Workspace will downgrade them in all other Workspaces.

### Add an existing user to another Workspace in your Organization <a href="#h_01hd265czwgxxhw06htehn3csw" id="h_01hd265czwgxxhw06htehn3csw"></a>
