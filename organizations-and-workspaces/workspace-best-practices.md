# Workspace Best Practices

### Workspace Best Practices

Organizations on a Business or Enterprise plan have the ability to create more than one Workspace. However, it’s important to know the implications of separate Workspaces so you can determine what setup makes the most sense for your organization. The answer in short, is that most of the time it makes sense for an organization to have only one Workspace. This means everyone can collaborate in one space and has the ability to work across teams and see org wide progress on projects.&#x20;

**Key Considerations:**

* No reporting across Workspaces. For most organizations having a global view of reporting and metrics is key to success so consider this before creating more than one Workspace.
* Currently there isn’t the ability to make Stories, Epics, or Objectives private. If there is sensitive information that needs to be private from parts of your organization this could be a situation where separate workspaces make sense.&#x20;

**Situations where more than one Workspace is recommended:**

* A Workspace used as a Sandbox, this can be good for owner or admin testing needs.
* When there is sensitive information that can’t be shared with the entire organization. Examples where this could make sense for Legal, HR, Finance.
* Agencies that want to use separate workspaces individual clients. An Enterprise plan would be required for this use case as this plan allows for unlimited workspaces.

**Situations where more than one Workspace is NOT recommended:**\


* Workspaces broken out by team.
* Workspaces by initiative.
* Workspaces for different products.

When it comes to creating Workspaces, planning for the future state is best. As a rule of thumb, try to stick to one workspace. Maybe metrics and reporting don’t seem key now but as your team scales this need for a high level view of work and projects could become essential.&#x20;
