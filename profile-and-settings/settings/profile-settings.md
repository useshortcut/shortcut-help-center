### Managing Your Profile <a href="#h_01jk6sw08hg710g68s56sgvjt1" id="h_01jk6sw08hg710g68s56sgvjt1"></a>

Your profile is created when you set up your Shortcut account and your full name, username, profile icon, and UTC offset (used in email notifications) persist across all your Shortcut Workspaces. To access the Profile Settings:

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the lower left of the UI or under the Profile Icon in the upper right.
2. Select **My Profile**

### Profile Icon <a href="#h_01jk6swrpba9ca5w1pd29e95ye" id="h_01jk6swrpba9ca5w1pd29e95ye"></a>

By default, Shortcut will use a circle with your initials as your profile icon. To set a different Profile Icon:

1. Navigate to **Settings > My Profile**&#x20;
2. Select **Upload** Icon.
3. You will be prompted to upload your image.

To crop your profile image, hold **Shift** and drag the file onto the Your Profile Icon area.

### Adding Additional Emails <a href="#h_01jk6sxaa4v0gzjfh1s6s2x8np" id="h_01jk6sxaa4v0gzjfh1s6s2x8np"></a>

Since we realize that many users may be using integrations linked to a different email address than the one used to establish their Shortcut account, Shortcut supports multiple email addresses. Adding another email address allows you to log in using that address and will link any GitHub commits made by that address to your Shortcut user account.

To add additional email addresses:

1. Navigate to **Settings**
2. Select **Email Addresses**
3. Add a new email address
4. A confirmation email will be sent to the new address
5. Once confirmed, you can adjust the primary and secondary email addresses or delete the old email address.

Note: Only your primary email address will receive system emails from Shortcut.
