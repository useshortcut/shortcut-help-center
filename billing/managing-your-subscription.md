# Managing Your Subscription

1. You must be an [Owner of the Organization.](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019189311)
2. [Disable your Organization ](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360046427591)via the Manage Organization and Workspaces page.

Disabling your Organization only suspends your Shortcut account, it does not remove your payment information. Contact our Support team if you'd like to remove payment information from your account.

Please note:

* If your Organization is currently on a Legacy plan, pausing or canceling your Shortcut subscription will also result in loss of access to Legacy pricing and entitlements. A prompt in app will notify you of this prior to completing the [Disabling an Organization](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046427591) process.
* Please see [our pricing page](https://shortcut.com/pricing) for more information regarding the current pricing and entitlements structure or contact Shortcut support with further questions.

### Why was my Organization Disabled? <a href="#h_01hhqnzzqy7tk0c21repfx597s" id="h_01hhqnzzqy7tk0c21repfx597s"></a>

Only an Owner can disable an Organization, so we recommend that you first check with other Owners in your Organization. If you've done this and still aren't sure why your Organization was disabled, we recommend that you [contact our Support team](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) for individual assistance. In general, a billing issue is the most common reason Organizations are disabled.&#x20;

**Did your most recent payment fail?** If your payment fails and an invoice is marked as uncollectible, we'll reach out to the Organization Owner or Owners about resolving the outstanding invoice. If we don't hear back and/or no payment is made within 5 business days, the Organization will be disabled and locked, and the subscription canceled, until the outstanding invoice is paid. We'll keep the Organization data just as you left it until you're ready to resume the subscription. Please note that upon enablement, a new subscription billing cycle will start, and a new invoice will be issued.
