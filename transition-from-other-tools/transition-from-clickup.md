# Transition from ClickUp

To help you transition from ClickUp to Shortcut, use the handy ClickUp-to-Shortcut translations below to guide you. Shortcut is designed for software teams, so you'll find the features and names are developer-focused.

For more information on the Shortcut hierarchy and how to best set up your workspace, check out[ Get to Know Shortcut's Structure.](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/23970339393172-1-Get-to-Know-Shortcut-s-Structure)

### Shortcut Stories vs. ClickUp Tasks/Sub-Tasks <a href="#h_01jmctm5krpknpf99f03vms3c3" id="h_01jmctm5krpknpf99f03vms3c3"></a>

**Definition**

A Story represents an individual piece of work to be completed in a Workflow, which can be broken down with subtasks.

**Best Practice**

Stories are the fundamental units of work in the Shortcut hierarchy. A Story should be an individual piece of work that takes 1-2 days to complete (no longer than a week or two). If a Story is larger than this we recommend breaking it down into several Stories and using Story relationships to relate the Stories to each other. Learn more about how to set up and use Stories [here](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/sections/201151629-Stories-Story-Templates).

**Additional Story Features**

| Shortcut Feature          | ClickUp Feature | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Requester                 | Assigned By     | The **Requester** is the user that requests for the Story to be completed.                     |
| Owner                     | Assignee        | The **Owner** is the user that will actually complete the Story work.                          |
| Following                 | Watchers        | **Following** is a user that would like to follow the Story but is not the Requester or Owner. |
| Estimate Field on a Story | Time Tracked    | **Estimate field** is where Story points are added, this points scale is customizable.         |

### Shortcut Tasks vs. ClickUp Checklists <a href="#h_01jmctmd9hpd0715x6wht49h2t" id="h_01jmctmd9hpd0715x6wht49h2t"></a>

**Definition**

Tasks are binary entities within Stories and work like checklists. Tasks live within the Story as a list of items to be completed on the Story.

**Best Practice**

Tasks in Shortcut are meant to help you create a checklist and remind you of the items that need to be done in order to complete the Story, assign the steps to owners, and in general, help outline what goes into a Story in order to complete it. To make sure you are using Tasks efficiently, a good rule of thumb is that a Task shouldn’t take more than an hour to complete. If it will take longer, you should consider making it a Story and relating it to the Story rather than having it as a Task on the Story.

### Shortcut Epics vs. ClickUp Targets/Lists <a href="#h_01jmctmjh515gnth5ajqfaqqra" id="h_01jmctmjh515gnth5ajqfaqqra"></a>

**Definition**

An Epic is a collection of Stories representing a larger body of work or feature.

**Best Practice**

In Shortcut, an Epic is a distinct object or large goal, which makes it easier to organize and view your work. In Shortcut, Epics can span multiple Workflows and even Teams as needed. Learn more about Epics [here](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/sections/201211075-Epics).

### Shortcut Objectives vs. ClickUp Goals <a href="#h_01jmctmv1hrjzt4ert0d239kqx" id="h_01jmctmv1hrjzt4ert0d239kqx"></a>

**Definition**

An Objective is a collection of Epics representing a larger initiative with a common goal and is the highest level of organizational hierarchy in Shortcut.

**Best Practice**

Objectives are high-level company goals. They represent the big projects that have the highest impact on the business. Having another layer of hierarchy makes it easier to track higher-level progress, which makes it easier for executives and anyone in need of a big-picture view to zoom out or dig in to the details as needed.This is also very useful for teams and individuals to know what goals they are working towards. Learn more about Objectives [here](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/sections/203244666-Objectives).

### Shortcut Teams vs. ClickUp Teams/Spaces <a href="#h_01jmctmzqa8ttn8fb60sazrq1e" id="h_01jmctmzqa8ttn8fb60sazrq1e"></a>

**Definition**

A Team represents a cross-functional squad, or any other group of Shortcut users who collectively own Stories, Epics, and Iterations.

**Best Practice**

Teams are core to organizational structure and are easily filterable.Teams are easy to set up and manage, allow you to add and customize workflows, and make it easy to view and edit the work that matters to you. Teams can simply be removed or changed from an entity as needed. Learn more about Teams [here](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/sections/360012895951-Teams).

### Shortcut Iterations vs. ClickUp Sprints <a href="#h_01jmctn3wzb85g92pan4wax9pm" id="h_01jmctn3wzb85g92pan4wax9pm"></a>

**Definition**

An Iteration is a time-boxed period of development for a collection of Stories that can span multiple Epics and Workflows, and can be used to track sprint cycles.

**Best Practice**

Iterations are an optional Shortcut feature for teams the run sprints, or some version of them. The Iteration page provides a Burndown chart, Cycle Time/Lead Time Chart, and Cumulative Flow Diagram making it easy to track progress and get ahead of roadblocks. On the Stories page you can create a saved space for your current Iteration for an additional place to view Stories in each Iteration. Creating and linking Docs to your Iteration make planning, tracking, and completing Iteration seamless and all in one place. Learn more about best practices for running Iterations [here](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/sections/360004690231-Iterations).

### Shortcut Saved Spaces vs. ClickUp Spaces <a href="#h_01jmctn85e46j07p2cv26548nj" id="h_01jmctn85e46j07p2cv26548nj"></a>

**Definition**

Saved Spaces are filtered views of the Stories page. Filter by workflow, Team, quick filters, Iteration, and more.

**Best Practice**

Use Saved Spaces on the Stories page to create filtered views that show your work, you teams work, and any other customized board view you need. The Stories page can quickly toggle workflows and filter on various dimensions, so there is no need to create siloed views. Learn more about [Saved Spaces](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/208180646-What-are-Spaces-).

### Shortcut Workflows vs. ClickUp Status <a href="#h_01jmctnbdhmn2ezd4bnmbzs3cr" id="h_01jmctnbdhmn2ezd4bnmbzs3cr"></a>

**Definition**

A Workflow is a set of States customized by your organization as the process through which Stories and Epics move from creation to completion.

**Best Practice**

Workflows in Shortcut are no longer a pain. Shortcut Workflows are linear, but can still transition Workflow States based on VCS actions.

The Workflow and Team relationship is many-to-many. Teams are assigned as many Workflows as are needed and a Workflow can be assigned to numerous Teams. For example, all the Teams could use the same Engineering Workflow, or if needed, each could used a customized engineering Workflow. Different Story types do not have different Workflows. Overall, its easier to standardize Workflows across your organization. Learn more about Workflows [here](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016617052-Managing-Your-Workflows).

### Shortcut Docs vs. ClickUp Docs <a href="#h_01jmctnfdn8qy49p2yex6gkqmw" id="h_01jmctnfdn8qy49p2yex6gkqmw"></a>

**Definition**

Docs is a documentation tool that allows you to seamlessly connect to your work and Docs, making it easy to plan, build, and ship new features.

**Best Practice**

Shortcut Docs are part of the Shortcut platform. In Shortcut you don’t need to jump from tool to tool but instead have all your work and Docs all in one tab. In Docs you can create and link Stories, Docs, Epics, Objectives and Iterations right from the Doc. Learn more about Docs [here](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/6510907441428-Docs-Overview).

### Shortcut Power Bar vs. ClickUp Command Center <a href="#h_01jmctnpc7b5ewxfdp8mgj4kc3" id="h_01jmctnpc7b5ewxfdp8mgj4kc3"></a>

**Definition**

The Power Bar contains search, support, and keyboard shortcuts all with on click or command. Find it under the lightning bolt in Shortcut.

**Best Practice**

Save time by taking key actions in Shortcut with keyboard shortcuts. Create a Story from a template, create an Epic, navigate to a new page and more all with a keyboard command. You can also find and search for help documentation and learning videos directly in the app. Learn more about the Power Bar [here](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061689571-Power-Bar).

### Shortcut Status Page vs. ClickUp Workload View <a href="#h_01jmctnvcjd5692tre5h2mp6fj" id="h_01jmctnvcjd5692tre5h2mp6fj"></a>

**Definition**

The Status Page is where you can get a full overview of all the people in your Workspace and their assigned Stories.

**Best Practice**

The Status page displays all Unstarted, Started, and Recently Done Stories by the Owner. This page is useful for seeing what everyone is working on right now and planning to work on next. The Stories view works best for smaller teams and filtered views, and the Compact view provides a higher-level view for larger teams.
