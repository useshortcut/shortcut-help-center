# Two Factor Authentication (2FA)

For added security, we encourage you and everyone in your organization to use either Google OAuth to log in or to set up two-factor authorization (2FA) for your Shortcut account. If you're using Google to sign in to your account, you won't be prompted for 2FA from Shortcut. Instead, you'll want to turn on 2-Step Verification for your Google Account.&#x20;

If you want to add 2FA to your Shortcut account in addition to using Google OAuth, you may need to set a password before you can add 2FA.

**Turning on Two-Factor Authentication**

Follow these steps to enable 2FA in Shortcut.

1. Navigate to your **profile** **icon** or **photo**
2. Select **Settings**
3. Select **Security** under Your Account
4. Select **Two-Factor Auth**
5. You will be prompted to re-enter your Shortcut password. Re-enter it and press **Continue**.
6. You will then be presented with a two factor authentication QR code to scan.
7. Select **Confirm** after entering your two-factor code.
8. The confirmation screen will include your new Recovery Code. **Copy your Recovery Code** somewhere safe, and then select **OK, I saved my recovery code**.

**Logging in with Two-Factor Authentication**

1. Enter your **username** or **email**
2. Enter your **password**
3. Select **Log In**
4. Enter your Two Factor Authentication code. You can find this in the mobile authentication app you used when you set up your 2FA (e.g. Google Authenticator, Authy).
5. Select **Log In** again

If you cannot access your 2FA app, you can log in using your recovery code. If you've lost your code and need your 2FA disabled, have an Admin or Owner reach out to support to disable it for you.

**Using Your Recovery Code**

If you cannot access your mobile authenticator app for your two factor authentication code (for example, if you're logging in from a new mobile device), you can log in using your recovery code. Use your recovery code by selecting **Need to use your recovery code?** on either the login screen, or the 2FA screen. &#x20;

If you've misplaced your recovery code, please have someone with **Owner** or **Admin** permissions [contact Shortcut Support](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) to have your 2FA disabled.

**Turning off Two-Factor Authentication**

If you no longer wish to have two-factor authentication security in your account login, you can follow these steps to disable it.

1. Navigate to your **profile** **icon** or **photo**
2. Select **Settings**
3. Select **Security** under Your Account
4. Select **Two-Factor Auth**
5. You will be prompted to re-enter your Shortcut password as well as the two-factor authentication code from your authenticator app.

Select **Disable 2FA**. 2FA will now be disabled.
