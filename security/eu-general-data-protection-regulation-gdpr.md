* For more detail about the regulations, you can [visit the official EU site](https://gdpr.eu/).

**When did this take effect?**

The new regulations took effect on May 25, 2018.

**Who does this impact?**

This impacts Shortcut along with most of Shortcut’s customers.

**Is Shortcut a data processor or a data controller?**

Shortcut is both a data processor and data controller. We process our customer’s customer data and control the data of our customers that log into Shortcut. We have certain requirements and liability for both.

**Individual Rights**

There are 8 data subject rights under GDPR:

**Right to be Informed**

This right emphasizes transparency to individuals and provides an obligation to provide ‘fair processing information’ while using clear and plain language at the time the customer obtains consent to begin collecting personal data.

**Right of Access**

This right helps individuals access their personal data so they are aware of and/or verify the lawfulness of the processing.

**Rights related to Automated Decision Making**

This right provides safeguards to individuals against the risk of a potentially damaging decision to be taken without human intervention.

**Right to Object**

On certain grounds, this right provides an individual to object to data processing for the purposes of profiling or direct marketing.

**Right to Rectification**

This right states that individuals are entitled to have personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete.

**Right to Erasure**

This right enables an individual to request the deletion of personal data if it is no longer necessary or the data subject withdraws consent.

**Right to Restrict Processing**

This right provides individuals to have a right to ‘block’ or suppress processing of personal data.

**Right to Data Portability**

This right allows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services.&#x20;

**How to Invoke Your Rights**

If you need a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) or otherwise have a request to invoke any of your rights as listed above, contact the Shortcut support team at privacy@shortcut.com from the email address associated with your account, with the subject line "GDPR Notice."

Since Shortcut is also a data processor, you may have a customer who needs to be removed from your Shortcut account. In this case, you should still contact the Shortcut support team at privacy@shortcut.com to process this request.

Note: Requests for Erasure & Data Portability Rights will take up to 30 days to help meet required compliance timelines.

**In the event of a GDPR Breach**

In the event of a breach, Shortcut will contact the affected Shortcut account owners and immediately trigger remedial action to ensure compliance. Throughout this process, Shortcut has added procedures to ensure effective communication with the affected customers.
