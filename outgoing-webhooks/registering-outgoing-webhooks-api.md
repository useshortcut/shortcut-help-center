# Registering Outgoing Webhooks (API)

### Registering Outgoing Webhooks (API)

If you're writing a custom integration with Shortcut and need to register a webhook that will receive updates via Shortcut's [Webhooks API](https://developer.shortcut.com/api/webhook/v1), you can use our REST API to set up your webhook programmatically.

### Authentication <a href="#marked-authentication" id="marked-authentication"></a>

All of these routes expect a [Shortcut token](https://developer.shortcut.com/api/rest/v3#Authentication) to be provided via the `Shortcut-Token` header. Shortcut users of your extension need to provide you a Shortcut API token generated by a non-Observer member of their workspace to perform these operations.

### Create a Webhook Integration <a href="#marked-create-a-webhook-integration" id="marked-create-a-webhook-integration"></a>

#### Request <a href="#marked-request" id="marked-request"></a>

```
POST https://api.app.shortcut.com/api/v3/integrations/webhook
Shortcut-Token: your-token
Content-Type: application/json

{"webhook_url": "https://example.com/", "secret": "a-secret"}
```

**Available fields:**

* `webhook_url`: the url where the webhook payloads should be sent (**required**)
* `secret`: a string value used to verify the payload. When your secret token is set, Shortcut uses it to create a hash signature with each payload that is passed along in the Payload-Signature header. Shortcut uses an HMAC hexdigest to compute the hash. (**optional**)

#### Response <a href="#marked-response" id="marked-response"></a>

The important field for most usage is the `id`. We'll use the id `500107362` in the examples that follow.

```
{
  "entity_type": "integration",
  "webhook_url": "https://example.com/",
  "disabled": false,
  "type": "generic",
  "creator_id": "5a7e1b9a-edb2-4c48-b31f-462864df62ca",
  "updated_at": "2025-02-11T12:36:31Z",
  "id": 500107362,
  "has_secret": true,
  "created_at": "2025-02-11T12:36:31Z"
}
```

### Get a Webhook Integration <a href="#marked-get-a-webhook-integration" id="marked-get-a-webhook-integration"></a>

### Delete a Webhook Integration <a href="#marked-delete-a-webhook-integration" id="marked-delete-a-webhook-integration"></a>
