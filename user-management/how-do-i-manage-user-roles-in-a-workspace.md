# How do I manage user roles in a Workspace?

If you're an Owner or Admin and wish to change someone's role in your Workspace, go to **Settings > Workspace Settings > User Directory** and use the drop-down next to the person's name to change their role.

**Note:** The User Directory is for managing users at the Workspace level; to [manage users for the entire Organization](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360018835532-How-do-I-manage-user-roles-and-membership-using-the-Manage-Organization-and-Workspaces-Dashboard-), or to promote a user to an Owner, use the [Manage Organization and Workspaces Dashboard.](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360001106066-The-Organization-and-Workspaces-Management-Dashboard)
