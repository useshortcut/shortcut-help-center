# How do I transfer ownership of an Organization to another user?

**If a current Owner is available:**

If you're the current Owner, you can transfer ownership of the Organization to another user.

1. Go to the [Manage Organization and Workspaces Dashboard](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001083483-The-Organizations-and-Workspaces-Dashboard) (click on your company's logo in the upper left corner, then click on **View All Workspaces**).
2. Once there, click on **Manage Organization and Workspaces.**
3. Find the userâ€™s row in the table and click the **role** drop-drown menu under the desired Workspace, then choose **Owner**.
4. You'll be asked to confirm the action: "Are you sure you want to promote **\[User]** to the role of owner? They will become an owner of every Workspace within this Organization." Click **OK**.

**If the current owner is no longer with your company or not available:**

If the current owner is no longer with your company or not available, we can change ownership of the account for you following a quick security measure. You will need to submit a written request to [support@shortcut.com](mailto:support@clubhouse.io) in the form of a PDF, including:

*
  *
    * The account URL
    * The name and email address of the previous account owner
    * The name and email address of the new account owner
    * The last four digits of the credit card number on file
    * The billing address of the credit card on file

The information should be in a letter on your company letterhead, signed by a manager at your organization. If your company doesn't have letterhead, please be sure to include your company's mailing address and phone number in the letter.&#x20;

**Note:** The request needs to be in the form of a PDF and be sent from an email address in the company's domain to support@shortcut.com.&#x20;
