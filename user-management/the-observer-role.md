# The Observer Role

### The Observer Role

With the Observer role, users can gain access to your [Shortcut](https://www.shortcut.com/) in order to view progress on an individual Story or across the Workspace. Observers can view Spaces, follow Stories, and use the various Search bars and filters. However, they cannot move, change, or comment on anything.&#x20;

More information:

* Observers can retrieve data, but not change data via the [API](https://clubhouse.io/api/rest/v3/). See [API tokens](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/205701199-Clubhouse-API-Tokens).
* Observers cannot create [Stories via Slack](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360021434071-Creating-a-Story-in-Slack-using-Slack-Actions).
* Observers are available **for free** to all Workspaces on a paid plan.
* Up to five Observers per paid seat.

Users can also be converted from Members, Admins, or Owners to Observers by going to User Directory and toggling the role next to the user's name to Observer. Your Workspace will not be charged for Observers.

**Observers and Permissions**

Please note that Observer role only limits what a user can do, it does not limit visibility. While Observers cannot make any changes, they still be able to see everything in the Shortcut Workspace.
