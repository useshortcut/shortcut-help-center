# Shortcut User Roles

### Shortcut User Roles

In Shortcut, we offer multiple user roles: **Owner, Admin, Member, and Observer.** By default, the first person in the system is given the role of Owner, but Organizations can have multiple Owners and Admins.

Free plan accounts do not have access to Member or Observer roles. For additional access, please consider [upgrading to a paid plan](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/billing) that best suits your team's needs. Additionally, while the Observer role is only available on paid plan, please note that there is a cap of up to five Observers per paid seat.&#x20;

Below you’ll learn more about each role type. When you’re ready,[ invite the rest of your team](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033599271-Managing-Invitations) and manage their roles easily from your **Account** **Settings**.
