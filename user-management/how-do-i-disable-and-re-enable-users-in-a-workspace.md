# How do I disable and re-enable users in a Workspace?

You can disable and re-enable users in your Workspace by going to **Settings > Workspace Settings > User Directory.**

To disable a user, click on the red "NO" symbol next to their name.\

To re-enable a user, go to the **Disabled Users** tab and click on the **Recycle** icon next to their role.

**Note:** A disabled user will appear here even if they've been removed from the Organization by the Owner. If you try to re-enable a user who's been removed by an Owner, you'll see this message:

In this case, [an Owner will need to re-enable the user in the Manage Organization and Workspaces Dashboard](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360018842372), and the user will need to be re-invited to the Workspace.
