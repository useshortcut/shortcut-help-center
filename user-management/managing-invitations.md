# Managing Invitations

### Managing Invitations

As Owner or Admin, you can invite users to your Workspace in a few simple steps. To invite new users to a specific Workspace, you can do so within the **Manage Organization and Workspaces Dashboard** by selecting the **Invite** button next to the Workspace name, or from **Settings** > **Workspace Settings** > **Invite New Users**. You can also add teammates through the "Owner" or "Comments" field on a story.

**Note**

Free plan accounts do not have access to Member or Observer roles. The Observer role is only available on the Team plan or above. For additional access, please consider [upgrading to a paid plan](https://app.clubhouse.io/settings/billing) that best suits your team's needs.

### Invite Methods <a href="#h_01jrwtf2gdcx79vgyd3zx36sx4" id="h_01jrwtf2gdcx79vgyd3zx36sx4"></a>

*
  * Enter the **email address**(es) you wish to invite
  * Select the [**Role**](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019189311-Clubhouse-User-Roles) for which you'd like to invite the User(s):
    * **Owner**
      * You must invite a user as a **Member** or **Admin** first.
      * Once accepted, you can then promote them to **Owner**.
    * **Admin**
    * **Member (paid plans)**
    * **Observer (paid plans)**
  * Click **Send Invitations**
*   Create a link to quickly invite your team to Shortcut as **Members (paid plans only)**. Select the **Create** button to generate a unique invitation link. All new users from this link will join as [Members](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019189311-Clubhouse-User-Roles), but you can [adjust their Roles](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360033599771-Managing-User-Roles) as needed. This invite link is unique to your Workspace.

    Invitation links can be disabled at anytime by selecting the **Disable invite link** trash can icon. Once deleted, you can generate a new link at anytime. We do not recycle links.

    **Note**: Once you either invite via email, or your team provides their email to an invitation link, they are counted as billable users, so it's a good idea to check your User Directory and Invite News Users menu periodically. Deleting unused invitations will help you avoid being charged for teammates who aren't using Shortcut in the next billing cycle.
*   Invite your teammates from Google Contacts. You can select which contacts are invited into Shortcut.

    * Click **Invite Contacts** tab
    * Authorize with Google by selecting **Invite Google Contacts**
    * Shortcut will display a list of your Google Contacts so you can choose who is invited.
      * Note: Shortcut does not permanently store this Contact data. You can manage the data by selecting **Clear Google Contacts** or **Refresh Google Contacts** at the bottom of the screen
    * Select the user and role to invite

    Note: Shortcut will first check your Google company Directory. If there are no emails in the Directory, we will then check your Google Contacts.
*   Invite your teammates by allowing us to match their email domains. Organizations will be visible and can be automatically joined (without an invite) when users are signing up with email address from a matching domain. Members of your workspace will also be able to invite teammates with a matching email domain from the "Owner" or "Comments" fields on a story.

    Please note: The Organization will be immediately charged for any new users on a paid plan, and will need approval from an account Owner to upgrade if your Free plan already has 10 users.

    * Select the **Settings** tab
    * Select **Discoverable and open to anyone with a matching domain**&#x20;
    * Shortcut will display your verified domains
      * Toggle any domain you wish to be discoverable on or off

    Note: In order to make a workspace discoverable, the domain must match the email address domain of at least one owner or admin in the workspace.

### Re-sending Invitations <a href="#h_01jrwtdvvxndpp0z98eh5pregx" id="h_01jrwtdvvxndpp0z98eh5pregx"></a>

If a teammate fails to receive an initial invitation, you can resend the invite by going to **Settings > Workspace Settings > Invite New Users** and then clicking the recycle icon to resend the invite. If you try to re-send an invite within 24 hours of originally sending it, Shortcut will alert you (and prevent the invite from being re-sent).

### Deleting Invitations <a href="#h_01jrwtdvvx96mc1sykp4nhm58x" id="h_01jrwtdvvx96mc1sykp4nhm58x"></a>

Unused invitations are counted as billable users, so it's a good idea to check your **User** **Directory** and **Invite** **News** **Users** menu periodically. Deleting unused invitations will help you avoid being charged for teammates who aren't using Shortcut.

**To delete an unused invitation:**

1. Go to **Settings > Workspace Settings > User Directory.**
2. Click the garbage can icon to delete the invite.

You can also delete invites by going to **Settings > Workspace Settings > Invite New Users** and clicking the garbage can icon to delete the invite.
