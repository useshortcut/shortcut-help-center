# Importing data from Pivotal Tracker to Shortcut

To make it easier to move data from Pivotal Tracker to Shortcut, we built an MIT-licensed open source import tool that customers can modify to get their data into Shortcut, leveraging our API.&#x20;

_**Please be aware that this is alpha software.** Not only is not guaranteed to be without bugs, but it is under active development and has several known feature gaps to be filled before we consider it complete._

#### Getting Started <a href="#h_01hv4w3g1hyb8f5dm1p01nj3dh" id="h_01hv4w3g1hyb8f5dm1p01nj3dh"></a>

In order to run our importer, you will require a Pivotal account and the ability to sign up for a Shortcut account, as well as a working internet connection.

* **NOTE:** Do not run this importer against an existing Shortcut workspace that already has data you wish to keep.
