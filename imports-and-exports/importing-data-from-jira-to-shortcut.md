# Importing data from Jira to Shortcut

Bringing the work your team has completed elsewhere has never been easier. With our Jira importer, your progress, history, insights, and all the wins you’ve made together elsewhere can now be imported directly into Shortcut.&#x20;

We’ll work to improve every facet of this import process using your direct feedback and insights along the way. Ready to get started?

Preparing for the import will ensure a smooth process from start to finish. Here are some key things you'll need to complete this process:

And, while certainly not mandatory, it could be helpful to consider doing this optional step as well:

Jira Epics will be imported as Shortcut Epics. Jira Subtasks will be imported as Shortcut Stories with a dependency on the parent Story from Jira.

What's next? You can now directly check out the contents of the Project housing all of your Jira data, or invite any users that weren't mapped during the process.&#x20;

Your imported data should be easy to identify around Shortcut by their new Labels. Head to the Labels page and view the newly created Labels that accompany the Jira data. You can also use our [bulk Story editor](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360044698631) to make large-scale changes on Labeled Stories.&#x20;

Need to roll back this import and try again? That's easy, too! Head back to the Import screen within Shortcut and navigate to the Past Imports thread. From here, you can delete previous imports

### **Need to Run a Second Import?** <a href="#h_01h966x7b3hrtw13s3tnbx5vvx" id="h_01h966x7b3hrtw13s3tnbx5vvx"></a>

Running a second import will create new stories for Jira tickets that have already imported, resulting in duplicates.

Another point.

There are a few of options to get those additional tickets into Shortcut as Stories:

1. Create a new Jira project, move the new tickets there, then import just that project (this is the easiest option, but note that these won’t be in the proper project in Jira, if that matters.)
2. Rollback the prior import completely and re-import to get the new stories (Note that this will cause any changes done on the Stories that were part of the prior import to be lost)
3. Do a new full import into a different project, then move the net new stories to the correct project, followed by a deletion of the remaining duplicates - very manual or would require scripting!
4. Create new Stories manually in Shortcut for the new tickets in Jira
