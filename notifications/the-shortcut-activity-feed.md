### What You See in the Shortcut Activity Feed <a href="#h_01jfgctxzz7q40knezqk238j5g" id="h_01jfgctxzz7q40knezqk238j5g"></a>

The Activity Feed updates you see are related to the Stories, Projects, and Epics that you are following. If you find you are not receiving updates about a particular Story, Project, or Epic, click on it (or visit the top-level page in the case of Epics and Projects) and make sure you are listed under Followers.

_Changes to files, labels, tasks, and due dates are not reflected in the Activity Feed._&#x20;

The Activity Feed offers two levels of user preferences that provide the ability to choose:&#x20;

1. If your own actions/changes are included in your Activity Feed. _Note: Even if you select "No, exclude my changes" your Shortcut activity will still appear in your teammates' Activity Feeds, just not in your own._&#x20;
2. Whether the Activity Badge appears for all new comments added to Stories/Epics you follow, or only if you are @-mentioned. &#x20;
