# Shortcut Email Notifications

### Shortcut Email Notifications

Shortcut email notifications allow you to receive regular email updates on the [Stories](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/sections/201151629-Stories) and [Epics](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/sections/201211075-Epics) that you are following. If you find you are not receiving news about Stories or Epics you are interested in, log in, click on the Story and Epic, and make sure you are selected as a Follower.&#x20;

When you follow an Epic, you will receive notification emails about every Story in that Epic.

You will not receive notifications simply because you are a Requester. While a Story Requester is added as a Follower by default, you should ensure you are indeed selected as a Follower to ensure you receive notifications.

Also, keep in mind that you will not receive notifications about actions you take yourself on Stories, Epics, or Projects, nor if you @-mention yourself.

  * Comments on Stories you follow
  * Direct @-mentions and Team @-mentions in Story or Epic comments and descriptions.
  * Threaded replies to your comments.
  * You will also receive a notification if you are added or removed from a Team in addition to Team-based notifications for Stories and Epics.
* **Important events:**
  * New Stories on which you are added as a Follower

  * Threaded replies to your comments.
  * You will also receive Team-based notifications triggered by a Story or Epic assignment to a Team.

  * You will also receive a notification if you are added or removed from a Team.
  * Note: All events in the daily summary come with a timestamp. By default, these timestamps are in the Eastern Time UTC offset, but if you wish to adjust your UTC offset so that the timestamps match your time zone, you can do so in [Your Profile](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/account).&#x20;

### **Replying by Email**  <a href="#h_01h96cgr4veg3sr5n0ppcs749n" id="h_01h96cgr4veg3sr5n0ppcs749n"></a>

You can reply to Story update emails to add a comment to that Story. @mentions will work as expected. Note: Email replies to threaded comments will reply on the Story but will start a new comment thread.
