Shortcut supports browser notifications in Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. If you have notifications enabled in these browsers, any time your Shortcut user name is mentioned in a Story comment or Epic discussion, you will receive a browser notification.

If you do not wish to click on your notification, the notification will dismiss itself in a few seconds if you are using Safari or Firefox. In Chrome, the notification can be dismissed by clicking the "x" in the upper right-hand corner of the notification.&#x20;
