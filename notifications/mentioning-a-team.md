# @ mentioning a Team

### @-mentioning a Team

Once a Team is created, you have the ability to @-mention the Team's handle across several areas of Shortcut:

* Within a Story card's description
* In a Story's comments&#x20;
* Within an Epic description
* In an Epic's comments
* Within an Objective description
* Within an Iteration description

If you are a Slack user, personal Slack notifications allow you to receive a notification from the "Shortcut" app if a Team in which you are a member is @-mentioned within Shortcut. These personal Slack messages can be responded to in-thread to push a comment to the Story or Epic in Shortcut (and emoji reacts work, too üëç).&#x20;
