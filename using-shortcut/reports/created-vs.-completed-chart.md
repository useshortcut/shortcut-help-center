The Created vs. Completed chart displays work created and completed within a period of time. Work is represented by either points or Story count.

The x-axis represents time; the intervals can be changed by using the Group By filter at the top of the Reports page.

**Note**

Group By Iteration is not supported by this chart.

The y-axis represents the number of points or Stories, which can be configured via the dropdown on the right.

"Stories Created" measures points or story counts for all stories created during that interval. "Stories Completed" measures points or story counts for all stories that moved to a "Completed" workflow state during that interval.
