# Working Days

### Working Days

![](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/37642910940564)Some teams don't work every day of the week, so counting and reporting on those off days is mostly unnecessary. Shortcut has a Workspace level setting that allows an Owner or Admin to set certain Working Days.

All calculations, metrics, and lines on the Burndown and ARC (Added/Remaining/Completed) Charts take Working Days into account to give you a more accurate representation of your work. The Default Working days are Monday through Friday, inclusive.
