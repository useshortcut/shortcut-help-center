# The Objectives Column View

### The Objectives Column View

The Column View is a high-level overview of all Tactical and Strategic Objectives, their associated key results and Epics, teams, owners, and more! Leverage the Column View for a snapshot of status and progress, expand key results to review Epic Health and status and more.&#x20;

Similar to the table view, the Column View can be filtered by the same filters for honing in on blockers, progress, or team-based views. Used the top right toggle to get back to the table view.&#x20;
