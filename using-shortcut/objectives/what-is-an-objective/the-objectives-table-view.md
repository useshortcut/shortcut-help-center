# The Objectives Table View

### The Objectives Table View

The Objectives table view is a great way to group and filter Objectives to monitor progress, identify goals on and off target, and keep track of work at a high-level.&#x20;

By default, all existing previous Milestones will still be shown, in the previously order ranking.&#x20;

**Available filters**

* Search (Objective Name)
* States
* Type ðŸ†• to show only Tactical or Strategic
* Teams
* Owners ðŸ†•
* Categories
  * _Existing categories will be shown. The ability to create new and edit/delete existing is upcoming._
* Option to show archived Objectives (including previously archived Milestones)
