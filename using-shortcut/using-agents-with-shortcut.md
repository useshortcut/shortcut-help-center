# Using Agents with Shortcut

### Using Agents with Shortcut

AI is no longer just a feature. It's a teammate. With Shortcut for Agents, you can assign work directly to AI agents and track progress alongside the rest of your team.

**Assign work. Track progress. Build faster.**\
Tag an agent in a comment or assign them a Story, and your AI teammates will scope tasks, write code, and move things forward. All within Shortcut.

Agent integrations like Devin, Codegen, and Bito are just the beginning. More are on the way, built on top of the Shortcut Agent API. A full development SDK will be available soon.
