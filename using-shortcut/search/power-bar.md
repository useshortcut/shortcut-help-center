# Power Bar

### Power Bar

[Shortcut](https://www.shortcut.com/)'s Power Bar is way to navigate, create, and use our most common features. With a simple keyboard command, activate the Power Bar and see what you can do!

**To use the Power Bar:**

* For Mac: Cmd + k
* For PC: Ctrl + k

Power Bar works in conjunction with the Keyboard Shortcuts; you can activate keyboard shortcuts at anytime, but if you forget a shortcut, just open Power Bar to search for the action and see a reminder.

There are 3 major functions of Power Bar (Navigate, Create and Do) that are combined into a single interface.

*   **Access any page** in Shortcut quickly by typing `Go to [page]`  in Power Bar, or just searching for the page. If you find yourself navigating between pages often, feel free to bypass Power Bar all together and use the keyboard shortcuts directly (`G then` )! These can be activated at anytime (no need to open Power Bar first), but also show up in Power Bar just in case you need a reminder of the shortcuts.
