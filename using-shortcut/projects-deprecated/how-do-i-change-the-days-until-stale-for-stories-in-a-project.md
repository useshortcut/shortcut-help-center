# How do I change the days until stale for Stories in a Project?

A Story is marked Stale when it is in an active Workflow State and has not been updated within a certain number of days. The “Days Until Stale” setting is set at the Project level - this article will walk you through how to set or update “days until Stories become stale” and how to disable Staleness entirely on a Project.

**To Set, Change, or Disable Story Staleness for a Project:**

1. Go to the Projects page by selecting it from the left menu bar
2. Click on the individual Project you wish to edit.
3. Looking at the information in the upper right, under Project ID, look through the options until you find the Days Until Stale feature
4. Set the number of days (it defaults to 5)
5. Or deselect the Enable button to disable the staleness indicators on Stories in this Project
