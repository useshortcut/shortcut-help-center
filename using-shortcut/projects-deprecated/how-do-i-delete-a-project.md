New [Shortcut](https://www.shortcut.com/) users will not have access to Projects as it is a legacy feature and will be phased out over time. Existing users can [toggle Projects off](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/projects/) or still use them for now however they will eventually be replaced by Fields. Have questions?

**Having Trouble Deleting?**&#x20;

Projects can be deleted only [when all Stories associated with that Project have been deleted](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044698631-Working-with-Stories) or moved to another Project.\


If you find that you [have deleted all visible Stories](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044698631-Working-with-Stories) and are still unable to delete the Project, click the **Show Archived Stories** checkbox next to the **Filter Stories** search bar on the Project page. Another option you have is to use the **project:** and **is:archived** search operators on the Search page. You will then be able to see any remaining Stories. Once you delete or move those Archived Stories, you should be free to delete the Project.
