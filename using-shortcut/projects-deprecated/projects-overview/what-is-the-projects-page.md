# What is the Projects Page?

### Please note!

New Shortcut users will not have access to Projects as it is a legacy feature and will be phased out over time. Existing users can [toggle Projects off](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/projects/) or still use them for now however they will eventually be replaced by Fields. Have questions? [_Read more here_](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/205702359#h_01G1PNENCKGCSPXFDYDKM8V6TJ)_._

The **Projects Page** provides an overview of all your Projects, the number of Stories they contain, and the number of points they represent (if you are using estimation points). You can access the Projects page by selecting **Projects** in the Shortcut sidebar menu.
