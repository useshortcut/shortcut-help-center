To add or edit the Project description, click on the **Add (or Edit) Description** button, make your changes, and then click on **Save** when you're done.

You can also edit the Project's Workflow, color, and abbreviation on this page, as well as change [the number of days until a Story in this Project is stale](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360016250591-How-do-I-change-the-days-until-stale-for-Stories-in-a-Project-) and the Project's Followers.
