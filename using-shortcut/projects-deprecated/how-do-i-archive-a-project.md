# How do I archive a Project?

### Please note!

New Shortcut users will not have access to Projects as it is a legacy feature and will be phased out over time. Existing users can [toggle Projects off](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/projects/) or still use them for now however they will eventually be replaced by Fields. Have questions?

Archiving a Project excludes it and all its Stories from Reports, Charts, and other places within your Workspace.
