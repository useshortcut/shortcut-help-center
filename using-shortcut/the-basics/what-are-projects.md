**What are Projects?**

Before the introduction of [Teams](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058866151), we encouraged the use of Projects as a way to categorize work by groups of users. Now that Teams and Workflows can be assigned to each other, we've decided to make Projects optional.

When creating a Story, you no longer need to assign a Project and can now leave it blank if you choose to!

Although Projects are now optional, they are still associated with Workflows. When creating a Story, selecting a Workflow will filter the available Projects to only those associated with the selected Workflow.

We envision Projects to be used as an optional form of further categorizing Stories. When areas of work become increasingly diversified, Projects may be a useful tool for some teams!
