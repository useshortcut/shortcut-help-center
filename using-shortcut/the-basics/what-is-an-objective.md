# What is an Objective

### What is an Objective?

Create goals, align Teams, and connect individual projects to company objectives. Now, not only can you roll-up work across multiple Teams in a tactical way using Objectives, you can also begin to track outcomes and impact using key results.&#x20;

Manage end-to-end planning cycles with new capabilities to track company Objectives directly in Shortcut and align the work teams are doing to directly impact those goals.

* **Two objective types: Tactical and Strategic.**&#x20;
  * All existing previous Milestones have been converted to Tactical Objectives, for planning more release-based, Epic driven work.&#x20;
  * Strategic Objectives introduces a new Key Result functionality that allows you to track outcomes and targets, aligning Epics either directly to the Objective or to a Key Result
* **Assign Owners and Teams** directly to Objectives.
* Assign an Epic to more than one Objective _(previously limited to 1 Milestone)_
* **New UI for the detail/management page** that gives first-class treatment to Objectives to differentiate them and elevate their purpose in Shortcut.
* Streamlined create Objective experience that explicitly lets you assign Epics directly during creation.

**Tactical** Objectives are available to all Organizations. However, **Strategic** Objectives are available on [our Business and Enterprise Plans only](https://www.shortcut.com/pricing#section-plan).
