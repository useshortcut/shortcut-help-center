# What are Workflows

### What are Workflows?

A Workflow (different from [Epic Workflows](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046059412-Epic-Workflow-States)) is the customizable process through which Stories move, from creation to completion and essential to cycle time reporting. Each Shortcut Workspace has one default Workflow with the option to add more.

**Note**

Free plan accounts only have access to one (1) Workflow for the entire workspace. For additional access, please consider [upgrading to a paid plan](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/billing).

### **It's easy to create new or customize your Workflows.** <a href="#h_01jmdqew5qn1kjf7yk7jykqyz1" id="h_01jmdqew5qn1kjf7yk7jykqyz1"></a>

You can create a new Workflow by navigating to **Settings > Workflows** and using the Workflow wizard (i.e. Create a New Workflow).&#x20;

**Step 1:** Name and describe your new Workflow - Assign a name to your Workflow - a description is optional.

**Step 2:** Add Teams to Workflow (optional) - You can assign Teams to a Workflow so that it appears under the Workflow field during Story Creation when the Team is selected.

**Step 3:** Select Workflow - You can select from our Standard Workflow (which is our sensible default for software development teams), Simple (which is the minimum Workflow for the system), or you can select to model your new Workflow after an existing Workflow.

Once you select the **Create Workflow** button, you will be brought back to the main screen where you can edit the name, description, and Workflow States of any of your Workflows.

**More assistance with managing your Workflows can be found** [**here: Workflows & Workflow States.**](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002459451-Workflows-Workflow-States)
