# Shortcut Labels and the Labels Page

Labels are a way to associate [Stories](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/205587589-What-is-the-Clubhouse-Stories-Page) and [Epics](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/115002692523). You can filter against Labels throughout various [Shortcut](https://www.shortcut.com/) views and search for Stories that carry them in the Stories filter section and on the Search page.

Labels can be edited, archived, or deleted from the Labels page.

If you choose to archive a Label, the Label will appear on the Labels page in grey italics with the word "Archived" next to it. Archived and deleted Labels will no longer appear among the choices of Labels in the drop-down menu when applying a Label to a Story, but archived Labels will not be removed from any Stories with that Label.&#x20;
