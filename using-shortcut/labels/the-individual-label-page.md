Visiting an individual Label's Page displays a list of Epics and Stories to which that Label has been attributed. The Epics section displays the name of each Epic that carries the Label, the number of Stories within the Epic, Owners, State, Progress and Due Date if applicable.

You can also [export a CSV of all of the Stories in a Label](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021396191-How-do-I-export-Stories-with-a-specific-Label-) by using the Export button.

The Stories section offers a table of all Stories with the Label as well as a breakdown of Story types and information on recent updates. The "Filter Stories" bar in this section operates as a search tool to surface specific Stories with the Label.&#x20;

Each Label page has an [ARC (Added/Remaining/Completed) Chart](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030472772).
