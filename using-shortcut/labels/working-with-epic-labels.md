# Working with Epic Labels

### Working with Epic Labels

[Labels](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/205702619-Labels-and-the-Labels-Page) are a way to associate Stories and Epics. You can filter against Labels throughout various Shortcut views and search for Stories that carry them in the Stories filter section and on the Search page. When a Label is assigned to an Epic, all Stories within that Epic display the Epic label.&#x20;
