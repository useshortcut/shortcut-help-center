# Workflow Filters in Shortcut

### Workflow Filters in Shortcut

While the Stories view is most significantly affected by having multiple Workflows feature, you will note a few other changes throughout your UI once you are using Workflows.

**The Status Page**![status-page.png](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/360033399791/status-page.png)

Much like the Stories page, the Status Page will be Workflow specific and can be changed by the Workflow switcher in the upper left-hand corner.&#x20;

The Workflow relationship is derived from Story Ownership. If a user owns a Story in the Story, they will appear on that Workflow's Status page.

**The Epics and Reports Page**

On the Epics and Reports pages, you can use the Project filter to narrow down your view to the project(s) on one Workflow.

**The Projects Page**&#x20;

Projects will now be separated by Workflow. You can also add new Projects to the Workflow from this page by clicking the **Create Project.** &#x20;
