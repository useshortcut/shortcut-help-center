### **Creating a new Workflow State** <a href="#h_01hmhwq3y50m96htt84rb73m0n" id="h_01hmhwq3y50m96htt84rb73m0n"></a>

To create a new workflow state, go to **Settings > Workflows States** and click on the "Add +" action next to the Backlog, Unstarted, Started, and Done States.

Give your new Workflow State a name, describe the Workflow State for your Team members if you like, and add a Commit Verb that can be used to move the Story forward to this State when you make **GitHub commits only**. Please note, Commit Verbs will only advance a Story forward through Workflow States. They cannot be used to move a Story backwards through States.

Once you’re finished, click **Save Changes**.

### **Deleting a Workflow State** <a href="#h_01hmhx0p5zq1ekenkz2dnvpvts" id="h_01hmhx0p5zq1ekenkz2dnvpvts"></a>

To delete an existing Workflow State, go to **Settings > Workflow States**, find the Workflow State you’d like to edit, and click on the pencil symbol on the right side of the Workflow State.

In the menu that opens, click on the "Delete State" action below the description field. You’ll be asked to confirm that you want to delete the Workflow State. Please note this action cannot be undone. When ready, select, "Yes, Delete"**.**&#x20;

The Workflow State will disappear from the State list, and you’ll see a success message pop up in the lower right confirming that the Workflow State was deleted.\

### **Having Trouble Deleting a Workflow State?** <a href="#h_01hmhxhm4yk57fx1316crcn0qa" id="h_01hmhxhm4yk57fx1316crcn0qa"></a>

To start, navigate to [**Settings > Workspace Features > Workflow States**](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/workflow) and **select** the Workflow you wish to delete from the dropdown.

You'll see that hovering over the Story symbol under each State will let you know how many Stories/Story Templates are associated with the respective State. Selecting this icon will open a Search page with the Story or Stories, _both active and archived_, in that State.

From this Search page, you can bulk edit those Stories to be reassociated to a new Workflow State or deleted entirely.

* Please note that only 25 Stories are shown at a time, but you can select "Load More" at the bottom of the results to show another 25 and up to 500 Stories can be bulk edited at a time.

To continue with the deletion of a Workflow State:

* Ensure the number of Stories or Story Templates left in this State is at 0 to move forward with the deletion.
* If for some reason this auto-populated Search is giving you trouble, check out this article on [Working with Stories.](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360044698631)
