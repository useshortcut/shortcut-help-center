# WIP (Work In Progress) Limits

WIP (Work In Progress) Limits help Agile development teams maintain focus and efficiency by setting a recommended limit to the amount of work in progress to prevent bottlenecks and ensure Stories are completed before picking up new ones.

Using WIP Limits in Shortcut, you can set a desired limit on the number of Stories in development for your team within each workflow. If this limit is exceeded, it will be visibly indicated in your Kanban view on your Team's Stories page, on any Space with WIP Limits enabled.

Only Admins have the ability to set the desired limits for Teams' Workflows and the associated States.

To set up WIP limits for a Team and Workflow, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [the Work in Progress Limits Settings page in your Workspace](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/wip-limits) (i.e. Settings > Work in Progress Limits)
2. Select a Team and Workflow
3. Set the desired Story count limit to any `Unstarted` or `Started` Workflow States
4. Save Changes

After WIP (Work in Progress) Limits have been set up, any user can now navigate to their Team's Stories Page and those limits will be visible on all Spaces filtered to the Workflow and Team with WIP Limits enabled.

While the WIP Limits Settings page can be accessed by navigating to Settings first, an Admin can quickly access that page using the More Actions dropdown (the ellipsis symbol) at the top of a Workflow State column and selecting "Edit WIP Limits".&#x20;
