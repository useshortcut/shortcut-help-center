# Using Workflow Columns

### Using Workflow Columns

The columns on the Stories page represent all the workflow states in the Workspace as defined in the **Workflow** section of your Shortcut settings.

Point totals for visible Stories in any given column are listed at the top of that column, and further information can be gathered by hovering over that number.&#x20;

You may choose to create a Space for yourself and/or your co-workers that hides certain Workflow States you don't want to see. At the moment, you can hide them by using the "Workflow State" filter with the "not any of" selected and then selecting the State, or States, that you do not wish to see.&#x20;

To unhide columns, you can do the following:

* Turn off the filter using the eye symbol. This will temporarily unhide the columns as needed.
* Remove the filter entirely using the x symbol
* Or unselect the respective columns individually.

### Done States <a href="#h_01jxad9w64k5xd43gby9ktnn6m" id="h_01jxad9w64k5xd43gby9ktnn6m"></a>

By default, all Stories in "Done" States are ordered by the date the stories were moved into the State, and the States are divided by week, starting on the Sunday of the week.&#x20;

You can automatically load older content by scrolling toward the bottom of the column.
