# How do I find Stories that have gone stale?

A Story is marked Stale when it is in an active Workflow State and has not been updated within a certain number of days as set on its Project. [Learn how to set or change the Staleness indicator on your Project here](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360016250591).

**To filter for stale Stories:**

1. Go to the Stories page by clicking on the menu bar on the left of the screen
2. Click on Add Filter, and select Stale
