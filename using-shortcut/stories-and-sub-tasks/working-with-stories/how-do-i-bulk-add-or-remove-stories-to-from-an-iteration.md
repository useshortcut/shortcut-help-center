# How do I bulk add or remove Stories to/from an Iteration?

First, please make sure that [Iterations are enabled in your Workspace](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/iterations).

You can bulk add, remove, or re-assign Stories to an Iteration anywhere you can [edit multiple Stories (see section for Bulk Editing Stories)](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044698631). This includes the Stories, Epic, Label, Dashboard, and Search pages. In addition, when you are on an [Iteration detail page](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029292711) or the general Iterations page, you can perform a bulk update for Stories that need to be moved to a different Iteration by selecting multiple Story cards.
