# How do I export Stories in a Project?

### Please note!

New Shortcut users will not have access to Projects as it is a legacy feature and will be phased out over time. Existing users can [toggle Projects off](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/projects/) or still use them for now however they will eventually be replaced by Fields. Have questions?

If you need to export all of the Stories in a Project, navigate to the page for that Project. In the Stories section, click the ![Export\_Project\_as\_CSV.png](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/7211687475604/Export_Project_as_CSV.png) button.
