# How do I export Stories from a Space?

If you need to export Story data that meet specific criteria, use a [Space with filters](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/206296205) to limit the Stories that you'll export.

When you are ready to export, click on the Space Menu in your Active Space Tab. Select the "Export" option.

You'll see a confirmation message that your export is in progress.
