# How do I filter by Iteration on the Stories page?

Make sure that[ Iterations are enabled in your Workspace](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028913112).

When on the Stories page, select and de-select checkboxes in [the Stories sidebar](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/206296205) to quickly filter by Iterations you care about.

If you'd like to easily jump back to a saved Iteration view at a later date, [share it with everyone in your Workspace](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/210137213), or [export its Stories to a CSV file](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021168791), you can save your Iteration filter as a [Space](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/208180646).&#x20;
