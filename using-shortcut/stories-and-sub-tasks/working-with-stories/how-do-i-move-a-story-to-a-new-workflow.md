# How do I move a Story to a new Workflow?

**Moving an individual Story to a new Workflow**

When moving an individual Story from a Project in one Workflow to a Project that uses another set of Workflows, you will be immediately prompted to select a Workflow State from the new Workflow State options.&#x20;

In this gif below, we're moving a Story from the Frontend project to the Mobile App Project, which uses the Mobile Workflow of the States that a Story must follow moving from Unstarted, to Started, to Done.&#x20;

**Moving multiple Stories to a new Workflow**

Several Stories can be bulk moved to a different Workflow. Select the Stories you wish to move to the new Workflow State (represented by selecting a specific Project that uses that Workflow State) by using the Edit Multiple action.

In order to set the Stories into the correct Workflow state, you will need to make two selections:\
1\. Select the Project from your desired Workflow where you would like to move the Stories \
2\. Select a Workflow State from the new set of Workflow options

**Moving Stories in an Epic to a new Workflow State**

Since Workflow States are shared across Epics, [the Epics page](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/205274149-The-Epics-Page) is one place where you can see several Stories from different Workflows.&#x20;

To move Stories in an Epic (that contains Stories that will follow different Workflows) to a new Workflow, select the Stories you wish to move using the Edit Multiple action.

In order to set the Stories into the correct, new Workflow state, you will need to make two selections:

1\. Select the single Project from your desired Workflow State where you would like to move all Stories \
2\. Select a Workflow State from the new set of Workflow options
