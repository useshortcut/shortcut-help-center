Once enabled, Story Templates allow you to create Stories from a pre-formatted template, saving you and your team time and effort on commonly written Stories.

With Templates, you can set and save elements of a Story for future use by your whole team, such as a Story’s title, type, description, tasks, Team, Epic, Owners, Custom Fields, labels, due date, and attachments.

Once you’ve created a Template, you can load it into any new Story, add information, and then save it as a new Story to be worked on. You can also update and manage all of your Templates in the Manage Story Templates menu at **Settings > Workspace Features > Story Templates**.

Story Templates can only be managed by Workspace Admins by navigating to [**Settings > Workspace Features > Story Templates**](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016736291). This includes enabling/deactivating Story Templates across the Workspace, and deleting existing Story Templates.
