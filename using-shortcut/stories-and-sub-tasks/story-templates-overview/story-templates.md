# Story Templates

The **Manage Story Templates** menu allows you to view all of your Workspace’s Templates in one place. There are two ways to get to the Manage Story Templates menu.

You can get there by opening the **Create Story from Template** menu (found by hovering over the right-pointing arrow in the **Create Story** dropdown menu) and then click on the **Manage Templates** button. Or you can get there by going to **Settings > Workspace Features > Story Templates.**

Templates are listed alphabetically, so the Template may move up or down in the list depending on its new name.

You’ll be asked to confirm that you want to delete the Template; if so, click **OK**. The Story Template will be immediately removed from the list of available Templates.

**Note:** Once a Template is deleted, it can’t be restored, so be sure before you click OK.
