In the **Story Templates** dropdown, the Templates are organized first by Team, then listed alphabetically.

Click on the Template you want to load, and a new Story dialogue will open with all of the Template’s information and formatting already applied.\

Templates are meant to make it easier and faster for you to create Stories with a common format, and so information that’s loaded into a new Story isn’t set in stone. You can add to or edit any of the fields that were pre-populated by the Template.

When you’re done editing, click the **Create Story** button.\
