# (Early Access) Sub tasks

Sub-tasks is currently available to a cohort of workspaces in Beta. If you would like to get Early Access to this feature, reach out to the team support@shortcut.com!

### Introduction to Sub-tasks <a href="#h_01jkxfa9xwgr5jmdk02dnj64va" id="h_01jkxfa9xwgr5jmdk02dnj64va"></a>

Sub-tasks in Shortcut help you break down user Stories into pieces of work for your team to execute on. Much like a Story, you can estimate, connect to VCS, and move Sub-tasks across your team's workflow.

Assign Sub-tasks to your teammates and view progress of Stories across Shortcut views. This is a new feature in Shortcut, and we would love to hear your feedback. Please let us know what you think by reaching out to our team or sharing in our community slack channel #product-feedback.

_**üí° Shortcut's Legacy Task feature will be deprecated. Questions on how to transition to Sub-tasks? Review this Help Center Article, or reach out to**_ [_**support@shortcut.com**_](mailto:support@shortcut.com)

### Convert Legacy Tasks to Sub-Tasks <a href="#h_01jvwkjdetwsc1q67pjrxjhk1v" id="h_01jvwkjdetwsc1q67pjrxjhk1v"></a>

Convert legacy Tasks to Sub-tasks via the action menu on individual tasks, or in the heading to convert all of them at once. ‚ùóÔ∏è**Note: Like Stories in Shortcut, Sub-task titles currently do not support Markdown formatting at this time.**

### Create Sub-tasks in Stories <a href="#id-01jv84n0v7v4tmdbtc4bf39arf" id="id-01jv84n0v7v4tmdbtc4bf39arf"></a>

Sub-tasks created in a Parent Story will inherit the Epic and Team fields (more inherited fields in development for GA release). Click into Sub-tasks to edit them and add a description.

### Sub-Tasks in Breadcrumbs <a href="#h_01jq4z1n35ksax6g1jc1nq2zc3" id="h_01jq4z1n35ksax6g1jc1nq2zc3"></a>

Use the breadcrumbs on a Sub-task to view other related Sub-tasks (with the same parent Story), or navigate back to the parent Story.

### Detach Sub-Task from Parent Story <a href="#h_01jq4z32zc7ykhzcjx538a1b6g" id="h_01jq4z32zc7ykhzcjx538a1b6g"></a>

Detaching a Sub-task from a parent Story will make it a standalone Story. You can also delete Sub-tasks directly via the three-dot action menu.

### Markdown Checklists <a href="#id-01jv84nwt458ss92th3g5h5vea" id="id-01jv84nwt458ss92th3g5h5vea"></a>

If you need to create a to-do list in a Story or Sub-task, you can add a Markdown checklist to the Story description. We are working on an independent Checklist feature for GA release of Sub-tasks.

### View Sub-tasks on the Stories Page <a href="#h_01jkxfar17akpvnm1nvd08y66p" id="h_01jkxfar17akpvnm1nvd08y66p"></a>

Parent Stories and any Sub-tasks in the filtered view show up on the Stories Page and detail pages in Shortcut. Filter on Sub-tasks using the filter system on the Stories page, or choose to quickly "Hide Sub-tasks" from the view. Visual indicators distinguish Sub-tasks and Parents from regular Stories.

You can filter on Sub-tasks on the Stories page in Kanban and Table Views using our filtering system. You can also quickly "Hide Sub-tasks" in all views. This filter is persisted in the URL like other filters.
