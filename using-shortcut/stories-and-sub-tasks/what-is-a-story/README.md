# What is a Story

### What is a Story?

Stories are the standard unit of work in [Shortcut](https://www.shortcut.com/), and are where collaboration and documentation begins. Stories can have a set of metadata that makes them unique. You can assign Owners to a Story; add Followers, so they may be notified of the Story's progress; add attachments (from images to executables), Labels, and more.

Each Story has a Comments section for open collaboration. Comments in Stories support [markdown](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/206271675-Using-Markdown-in-Clubhouse) and file attachments (Comments' attachments are separate from the Story's attachments).

There are 3 types of stories in Shortcut: **Features**, **Bugs**, and **Chores**.&#x20;

* **Features** are enhancements to the product.
* **Bugs** are issues that disrupt the usability of the product.
* **Chores** are any work that has to be completed but does not quite fall within the aforementioned types.&#x20;

You can access the [Stories page](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/205587589-What-is-the-Stories-page-) by selecting Stories in the Shortcut sidebar menu.
