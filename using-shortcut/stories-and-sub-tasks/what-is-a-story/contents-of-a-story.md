# Contents of a Story

![STORY\_COMMENTS\_2017-11-22\_at\_10.09.29\_PM.png](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/360097181251)

Discussion about a Story can take place in the **Comments & Attachments** section of the Story dialog. The comments field supports text, markdown, emoji, files, links, and code snippets. Clicking into the comment text area will provide you with numerous helpers.&#x20;

The system will share a message informing you of this and the Story card will have a pencil icon indicating that the Story has unsaved changes.

You can reference or call attention to a team member in a comment by typing "**@**" and then typing or selecting the person's username in the dropdown. They will receive an email notification (and Slack DM as well, [if enabled](https://shortcut.com/blog/slack-personal-notifications)).

**Upload File Limits**

The web app has a **50MB file** upload limit.&#x20;

An image attachment is restricted in three ways:

* Images attached to a story are scaled down to at most 360 pixels wide and 240 pixels high.
* Clicking on an image to display it hi-res in a lightbox causes it to be scaled to the size of the browser window. (So very tall and skinny images can become difficult to see)

You can add images to the comments field in three ways:

1\) **Click the image icon** to select a file to upload

![Attach files](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/14581732861716)

2\) **Drag and drop** the image from your computer into the comment area. Hold the Shift key to bring up the optional image cropper.

3\) **Copy/paste** the image from your clipboard _(NOTE: Copy/paste is currently only supported in Chrome. It will be added to other browsers when it becomes available in the spec)._

Animated GIFs will become static GIFS when copy-pasted.

If you want to reference a comment or file from another Story (or even the same Story), you can get the comment's unique URL by hovering over the comment's date and time, right clicking, and copying the link location.

In addition to using emojis in the text of a comment, you can also react directly to a comment.&#x20;

To react to a comment using an emoji:

1. Open the Story containing the comment.
2. Find the comment and move your mouse over the comment body.
3. Click on the **smiley face icon** that appears below the comment text (on hover the button will say **Add Reaction**).
4. Scroll or search to find the emoji you want, and then click on the emoji to add it to the comment.

To remove your reaction from a comment, click the emoji again.

**Note:** Emoji reaction updates won't trigger notifications or be included in the Activity Feed.
