# What is the Stories page?

![2024-07-25 15.59.22.gif](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/28812980670100)

### View Type <a href="#h_01j3nr6ef2beb3c4p1pvd3ga80" id="h_01j3nr6ef2beb3c4p1pvd3ga80"></a>

By default, all Stories appear in the **Kanban**-style view according to the Workflow state. The second type is the **Table** view, which allows you to group stories by several dimensions in the table. These view types can be changed via the View selector in the upper right corner of the page.

Regardless of the View Type, Stories' priorities in Shortcut are structured vertically. **The higher up in the column the Story, the higher its priority**. By default, newly created Stories populate at the bottom of their assigned workflow state column, but Stories can be dragged up and down to re-prioritize in either view. &#x20;

Users can adjust the visibility of Stories by collapsing empty Workflow State columns

### View Density <a href="#h_01j3np84xw4p8den8mga9dkqwe" id="h_01j3np84xw4p8den8mga9dkqwe"></a>

The default Stories page view features Story cards that display the following information:&#x20;

* Story type (indicated by icon)
* Owner information (owner icon)&#x20;
* Story staleness indicator (hourglass icon, if applicable)
* Story due date (in red, if used)
* Estimate points (highlighted in grey, if used)
* Labels

However, the Stories page is available in three views, which can be toggled:

**Title Only**

(as the name suggests)

**Minimal**\
Story names and story Owner(s) image&#x20;

**Standard**  \
The default view&#x20;

**Jumbo**\
Same as Standard but optimized for a full-screen view&#x20;

### Card Color <a href="#h_01j3np84xw9ywa5awhad3shwxh" id="h_01j3np84xw9ywa5awhad3shwxh"></a>

Just like View Density, the color highlight of the stories can be changed to match that of a number of attributes.
