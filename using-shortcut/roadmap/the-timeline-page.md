The Roadmap makes planning, visualizing, and communicating work across your organization even easier. Keep your team ahead of blockers, and collaborate on the best course of execution while managing expectations with an easily digestible big-picture look at everything going on.

With the Roadmap Timeline View, we allow _multiple_ Epics to be planned simultaneously. The Roadmap Timeline view is a visual representation (via a Gantt chart) of multiple Epics in a given year. You can also see Objectives alongside Epics, to connect your short-term efforts to long-term business goals.

* **Please note that in order for Epics and Objectives to show up on your Roadmap Timeline, they must have start and end dates.**&#x20;

The Roadmap feature can be accessed via the left sidebar navigation by selecting the Roadmap symbol however this feature is only available to Organizations subscribed to a paid plan.                                                                                          ![](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/23299587220244)

#### Epic Priority <a href="#h_01hccxa00zye6zd4c08q6kzbtv" id="h_01hccxa00zye6zd4c08q6kzbtv"></a>

Currently, Epics are ordered in the Roadmap by **Priority, which is set from the Epics Page based on the position in the tableview there**. Epics at the top are considered the "Highest" priority, while Epics at the bottom are considered the "Lowest" priority. While in the Roadmap timeline view, the interactivity of Epics is at your disposal.

You can drag-and-drop Epics above one another to designate their priority in the Roadmap. Moving them in the timeline view will impact the Epics tableview ordering as well.

#### Changing Epic dates <a href="#h_01hccxa00z5td4zjvtmr0b032d" id="h_01hccxa00z5td4zjvtmr0b032d"></a>

Besides changing their priority, Epics can have their Start and End date changed via simple drag and drop. Simply hover over the edge of an Epic's box in the Roadmap, and drag across accordingly. You can also drag the body of an Epic to change both its Start and End date at once.

#### Objectives Grouping <a href="#h_01hccxa00zpdkwagjvh075fnc1" id="h_01hccxa00zpdkwagjvh075fnc1"></a>

By default, the Roadmap page will show Epics ordered by priority. However, these can be grouped by their corresponding Objectives to get a better high-level overview of your organization's initiatives. You can view this by clicking on the **Display** dropdown > selecting **Show Objectives**. You may also choose to show or collapse all Objectives by default from this drop down. ![Video\_24-01-30\_17-49-50.gif](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/23299612454420)
