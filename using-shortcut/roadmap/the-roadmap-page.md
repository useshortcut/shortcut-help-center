The [Roadmap](https://www.shortcut.com/product/roadmap) offers a unique way to plan and share your product planning close to, and synced with the work that's happening all in a convenient Table View.&#x20;

Organized by Teams, and structured via Epics, the Table view is a new flexible way to curate what's in progress, upcoming, and being planned. Use scheduled or unscheduled Epics to showcase teams' product strategies.&#x20;

Using the Roadmap you can:

* _Create an engaging, dynamic view of your product planning_
* _Plan and prioritize with views that stay up-to-date as your team completes work_
* _Help teams async communicate Roadmap progress, status, and reflect their teams' focus_

### **Building your Roadmap** <a href="#h_01h9vb96be9bg6wgm01d8g1ne9" id="h_01h9vb96be9bg6wgm01d8g1ne9"></a>

![Epic Actions](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/18707598858772)

The **Table view** option is the new default page when clicking Roadmap from the navigation. This view displays Epics grouped by Teams.

* All non-archived Teams in your Shortcut Workspace will be automatically added to the Roadmap.
* Begin building your Roadmap using the `Add Epics` option in each grouping.
  * If an Epic is _not assigned_ to the Team, that Epic can still be added to that grouping to help craft cross-collaborative team roadmaps.

Up to 40 Epics can be added to each team grouping. If you add more than 40, the 41st+ **will&#x20;**_**not**_ show up.&#x20;

**Customizing what you see on the Table View**

To keep the Roadmap view focused, we've highlighted important planning details from across [Shortcut](https://www.shortcut.com/) to be shown on the Roadmap this includes:

* Epic Details (ID, Name, State, Dates, and Labels)
* Epic Progress
* Teams and Owners to understand at a glance who's accountable for what&#x20;
* Related Docs
* Associated Objectives to understand what Epics are associated with which goal/release

To support flexibility and encourage various use cases, columns can still be customized based on your preferences of what's shown/their placement in the table via the `Display` toggle

* The specific columns can be toggled on/off&#x20;
* The ordering of which column appears in what order across the table can be moved

### Epic Health <a href="#h_01h9vb96bevgx84tmnrbrccqqc" id="h_01h9vb96bevgx84tmnrbrccqqc"></a>

Unique to Roadmaps, you can add a new **Health** status with a contextual comment to indicate what is **On Track**, **Off Track**, **At Risk**, or **No Health**.

This new option quickly signals to anyone viewing the Roadmap where things are at and if there's anything that needs to be discussed and engaged with.&#x20;

![Roadmap Page Filters](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/18707598867732)

Use filters for various combinations of views once your Roadmap is created to get important snapshots of focused information.&#x20;

Table view filters are separate from Timeline views, and all existing Timeline Roadmap URLs/filters will remain the same if you've saved bookmarks of important views! Table view filters are retained so you can navigate away from the Roadmap Page and return to your selected filters.
