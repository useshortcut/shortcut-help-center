The Shortcut Backlog is powered by **Backlog Workflow States**. For instructions on the actual setup check out the [Backlog Page](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/13226909773972) article. Letâ€™s walk the recommended strategy for using the Backlog in Shortcut.

**The best way to manage the Backlog in Shortcut is to ensure you have Backlog States in a single workflow that represents work before you prioritize it in an Iteration.**&#x20;

* This keeps the work in the _same_ Workflow for easy drag-and-drop prioritization. When it is ready to be worked on it just needs to be moved to the next workflow state and added to an Iteration, both of which can be updated directly from the Backlog tableview.
* You can add Backlog states to any or all of your Workflows. This makes it easy to signal what's not yet a priority, needs research, or isn't yet ready for refinement.
* If you are new to Shortcut and just setting up you will notice there is a Backlog state added to the default Workflow. Admins can update these existing states in settings.

#### Create a Backlog process to inform your Workflow <a href="#h_01hvvs8sehq697p8f335m1vgfm" id="h_01hvvs8sehq697p8f335m1vgfm"></a>

The goal of a Backlog is to create a place where ideas and unstarted work can live.&#x20;

Workflow States can be customized to represent that work starts as an unprioritized idea, is being triaged, needs further research, or is simply awaiting to be prioritized. We recommend all teams leverage the same verbiage for the Backlog states. This ensures stakeholders all understand where work is prioritized accordingly.&#x20;

Keeping your states simple, but informative ensures your Backlog is a productive space for everyone to identify Stories upcoming. It ensures work doesn't end up going there to be forgotten about!
