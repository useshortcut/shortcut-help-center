![mceclip0.png](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/13226982393364)

The **Backlog** in [Shortcut](https://www.shortcut.com/) is a new page designed to help you better sort, manage and prioritize work before it properly makes its way into a Workflow.&#x20;

The Backlog page in Shortcut will enable users to:&#x20;

* See un-planned/new/under-defined Stories separately from active work
* Have confidence that the work they are scheduling from the backlog is ready
* Make it easy for everyone in your organization to locate where Backlog items are in Shortcut

**Workflow State Settings**

* Workflows State settings page - the ability to add Backlog states (before Unstarted)

### Get Started with Backlog <a href="#h_01hvvrmy2rwzf2dd61w8tc9qve" id="h_01hvvrmy2rwzf2dd61w8tc9qve"></a>

**Admins** and **Owners** can go to the Workflow State Settings Page to add Backlog workflow states to existing workflows. You can also create a new workflow that is dedicated to your Backlog process by creating a new workflow and adding only Backlog states.
