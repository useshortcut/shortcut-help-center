# What is the Status page?

The Status Page is where you can get a full overview of all the people in your Workspace and their assigned stories.

The Status page displays all Unstarted, Started, and **Recently Done (completed within the last 7 days)** Stories by the Owner. This page is useful for seeing what everyone is working on right now and planning to work on next. The Stories view works best for smaller teams and filtered views, and the Compact view provides a higher-level view for larger teams.

**Some things that might not be immediately obvious about this page:**

* The icon tells you the type of Story:

* The left border color next to the icon will change based on the Card Color setting applied on the Status Page.
