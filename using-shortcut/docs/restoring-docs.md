# Restoring Docs

### Restoring Docs

As we do not yet have revision history for [Shortcut Docs](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/6510907441428), if you have experienced a loss of any Shortcut Doc content, either from a system error or accidental/erroneous deletion, and are unable to undo out of the changes, we are able to help recover any lost content.

Please reach out to Shortcut Support at [support@shortcut.com](mailto:support@shortcut.com) with the following information:

* The Doc ID (located in the browser URL address)
* If possible, the approximate Day and Time of the content deletions.

If needing to request recovery of a previous version of a Doc, when restored, it is likely to overwrite any data inputted after the requested revision date. As such, prior to submitting a request for recovery, we typically recommend duplicating the Doc in its current state to copy any newly inputted data, if still needed as a reference.
