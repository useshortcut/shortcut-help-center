# Custom Fields FAQ

**Who will have access to Custom Fields?**

All Organizations will have access to the following Fields:

* Technical Area
* Skill Set
* Product Area
* Severity&#x20;
* Priority

Only Organizations on the Business and Enterprise Plans will have access to Advanced Custom Fields

**How are Custom Fields different than Labels?**

* **Custom Fields** help you establish a more structured process in your Workspace. Because Custom Fields and their values are controlled by your Admin - there is more structure to Custom Fields over Labels.
* **Labels** are great because anyone in your Organization can create them, but they lack the structure of Custom Fields. You should use Labels as a lightweight but unstructured way to organize your work.

**How many Advanced Custom Fields are allowed?**

* Each Workspace has a limit of 20 Advanced Custom Fields by default
* Basic Custom Fields (Shortcut-defined) do not count against this limit

**Is there a limit to the number of values per Custom Field?**

No limit yet
