### Custom Fields Overview

### What are Custom Fields? <a href="#h_01j7pfhfb0r58jzd1k85c33j4b" id="h_01j7pfhfb0r58jzd1k85c33j4b"></a>

**Custom Fields** are a part of the evolution of our [Data Model](https://shortcut.com/blog/previewing-our-streamlined-data-model) that elevates the Shortcut experience for more structure, organization, and flexibility.

The following **Custom** **Fields** can be added to Stories, each with its own subset values:

* **Technical Area**
* **Skill Set**
* **Product Area**
* **Priority**
* **Severity**

_To create your own Custom Fields and Values, learn more about_ [_Advanced Custom Fields here_](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/10088128310676)_._

An updated video to reflect the new UI is in the works!

### Custom Fields FAQ <a href="#h_01j7pfhfb1azvmh7a9ckhs1hgd" id="h_01j7pfhfb1azvmh7a9ckhs1hgd"></a>

*   All Organizations will have access to the following Fields:

    * Technical Area
    * Skill Set
    * Product Area
    * Severity&#x20;
    * Priority

    Only Organizations on the Business and Enterprise Plans will have access to [Advanced Custom Fields](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/10088128310676).

    * **Custom Fields** help you establish a more structured process in your Workspace. Because Custom Fields and their values are controlled by your Admin - there is more structure to Custom Fields over Labels.
    * **Labels** are great because anyone in your Organization can create them, but they lack the structure of Custom Fields. You should use Labels as a lightweight but unstructured way to organize your work.
