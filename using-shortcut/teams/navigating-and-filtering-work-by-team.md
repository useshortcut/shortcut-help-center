# Navigating and Filtering Work By Team

The power of Teams is unlocked using the Team navigation and Team filters. For more information about setting up your Teams check out [Teams Best Practices](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413309425300).&#x20;

### Team Focus Navigation <a href="#h_01jtrfme585cy9qp2zbgkj0029" id="h_01jtrfme585cy9qp2zbgkj0029"></a>

The Team Focus Navigation now allows users to view work that is relevant to a particular Team (e.g. Stories, Epics, Iterations, and Backlog). From the 'All Work' area Users can still view all work in the Workspace and filter as expected or choose to view work related to a specific Team or Teams and filter against the entities that are specifically related to that Team.

*   Select the ellipsis next to Teams to open the Teams dropdown. You can multi-select the Team views that are relevant to you as these are user-specific.

### Filtering Work by Team <a href="#h_01jtrfme59rsz0054r2t5kx5fw" id="h_01jtrfme59rsz0054r2t5kx5fw"></a>

* With your Teams listed on the left sidebar, you can quickly navigate to a Team-relevant page from anywhere within the UI by selecting that option under the Team:
  * Stories page: This is where you'll see all the Stories that are associated with a Team. You can adjust the Workflow view if the Team is associated with multiple Workflows.&#x20;
    * Spaces: Spaces on each Team-specific Stories page are automatically filtered to show Stories assigned to that Team.
      *
        * **Note:** Any Space you create that is filtered to the Team on the Team-specific page will be available on the Team-specific Stories page Spaces menu.
  * Epics page: This is where you'll see all the Epics that are associated with a Team. This means Epics that the Team owns or that contain Stories assigned to that Team. There can be multiple Teams associated with a single Epic.
  * Iterations page: This is where you'll see all the Iterations that are associated with a Team. This means Iterations that are owned by a Team or that contain Stories owned by that Team. You may also notice Iterations from other Teams as well since there can be multiple Teams associated with a single Iteration.
  * Backlog page: This is where you'll see all the Stories in the Backlog that are associated with a Team.

### Filtering in All Work by Team <a href="#h_01jtrfme59nrqakae5ns800xr0" id="h_01jtrfme59nrqakae5ns800xr0"></a>

*   When viewing the Stories page from the All Work section, you can filter Stories by Teams by clicking the Teams filter dropdown and adding the Teams filters.

    The Team-specific Stories page will not have a Teams filter option because they are automatically filtered to show Stories owned by that Team.

*   When viewing the Epics page from the All Work section, you can group Epics on the Epics list page by Teams, by clicking the Group By drop-down in the upper right and selecting Teams.

    The Team-specific Epics list page will not have a Team Group By option.
