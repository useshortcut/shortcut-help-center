# What are Teams

### What are Teams?

### Teams Structure <a href="#h_01htqmb09b53dpyxyv7c82aked" id="h_01htqmb09b53dpyxyv7c82aked"></a>

A Team represents a cross-functional squad, or any other group of users who work on projects together, or in Shortcut terms, users that collectively own Stories, Epics, and Iterations.

You'll notice that Teams have specific views below "All Work", so not only are they important for identifying groups of users, but they're also incredibly useful for organizing your Workspace.

Think of Teams as the key to unlocking collaboration in Shortcut. Use Teams to organize and measure your work according to the same development teams/squads/pods you already have within your company. This functionality gives your organization the structure to organize with the flexibility to customize to fit how your work.

Teams empower every Organization to represent people, work, and process more effectively so they can be collaborative and be productive. At the core of any software organization, Teams are what make great products successful. Teams in Shortcut represent the teams (or squads) you already have and that makes Teams easy to set up and to use.
