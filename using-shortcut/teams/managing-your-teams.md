The number of Teams that can be created is dependent on the subscription that is chosen

| **Plan**             | Free | Team    | Business  | Enterprise |
| -------------------- | ---- | ------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **Teams Available**  | 1    | up to 5 | Unlimited | Unlimited  |

For either method, the Create Team modal will open where you can:

* Add the Team name
* Add the @-mention name
* Write a description
* Select multiple Team members by selecting each user
  * **Note:** One user can be a member of multiple Teams.
* Add a Team profile icon which will help easily visualize the Team across various entities within Shortcut.

When ready, click **Create Team** and you're done!&#x20;

We recommend creating Teams in Shortcut based on the primary way your Organization groups its people and work. A Team is a group of people that collaborate on work towards a common objective. Teams often have a Roadmap, KPIs, Iterations, Ownership over specific features, or common rituals such as stand-ups and retros.&#x20;

While inside a Team detail page, you may change/update its name, @mention handle, description, and members.
