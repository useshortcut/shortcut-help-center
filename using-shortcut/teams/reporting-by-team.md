# Reporting by Team

### Reporting by Team

View Team performance by using the "Team" filter on the Reports page. For example, you can:

* Measure Team output using the "Velocity" Chart
* Analyze Team efficiency through the "Lead/Cycle Time" and "Time Spent in Workflow" State charts.&#x20;

The Teams filter on the Reports page filters the reports for all completed Stories that are assigned to the selected Team.
