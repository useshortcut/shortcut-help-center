# Single Epic Page

![](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/31324033417236)

Discussion about an Epic can take place in the **Comments** section of the Epic page. At the moment, unlike Story comments, Epic comments are threaded, which allows separate conversation to occur on the same section. The comments field supports text, markdown, emoji, files, links, and code snippets. Clicking into the comment text area will provide you with numerous helpers.&#x20;

If you happen to leave an Epic without saving your changes, your changes will be automatically saved.&#x20;

### Mention a user in a comment <a href="#h_01jadeaqejdj6txv389wfr5qex" id="h_01jadeaqejdj6txv389wfr5qex"></a>

You can reference or call attention to a team member in a comment by typing "**@**" and then typing or selecting the person's username in the dropdown. They will receive an email notification (and Slack DM as well, [if enabled](https://shortcut.com/blog/slack-personal-notifications)).

**Upload File Limits**

The web app has a **50MB file** upload limit.&#x20;

An image attachment is restricted in three ways:

* Images attached to a story are scaled down to at most 360 pixels wide and 240 pixels high.
* Images attached to a comment or description are scaled down to at most the width of the comment element, and at most 380 pixels high.
* Clicking on an image to display it hi-res in a lightbox causes it to be scaled to the size of the browser window. (So very tall and skinny images can become difficult to see)

You can add images to the comments field in three ways:

1\) **Click the image icon** to select a file to upload

2\) **Drag and drop** the image from your computer into the comment area. Hold the Shift key to bring up the optional image cropper.

3\) **Copy/paste** the image from your clipboard _(NOTE: Copy/paste is currently only supported in Chrome. It will be added to other browsers when it becomes available in the spec)._

Animated GIFs will become static GIFS when copy-pasted.

If you want to reference a comment or file from another Epic (or even the same Epic), you can get the comment's unique URL by hovering over the comment's date and time, right clicking, and copying the link location.
