_The Epics Page in Column View_

The Column view provides a modular look at your Epics. You'll find your **To Do** Epics in the left column, your **In Progress** Epics in the middle column, and your **Done** Epics in the right column.

You can drag and drop Epic cards to change their priority or state, and you can also use the Actions menu in the upper right of the Epic card to archive or delete the Epic.

**Elements of the Epic Card**

Epic cards in the To Do and Done columns provide basic information, such as a flag icon to indicate its state, the Epic's name, and icons that allow you to follow, move, or access the Epic's basic menu.

Here are examples of a To Do Epic card (left) and a Done Epic card (right):

The In Progress Epic card also gives you a graphical representation of the Stories in the Epic, organized by their workflow state:![Epic\_Card\_Stories\_and\_Workflow\_States.png](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/360013119331/image-14.png)

Hovering over the box will give you the Story type, ID, Project, workflow state, title, owner, number of points, and information about when it was last updated.

The background of each Story box tells you what type of Story it is and the color on the left border tells you which Project it belongs to.
