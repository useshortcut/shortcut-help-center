# What is an Epic

### What is an Epic?

An **Epic** is a collection of Stories that represent larger initiatives. Just like Stories, Epics move through a workflow and can be completed.

Because Epics can contain Stories from different Projects and different Workflows, Epics are a great way for cross-functional teams to collaborate. For example: a new feature might involve people from product, design, engineering, marketing, and customer support all coordinating and collaborating together to get from rough ideas to launch.

**Want to see Epics in action?** Explore our Demo Workspace, which contains pre-filled information that will allow you to see how it all works together. Access it by clicking on the "Help" option in the upper right of the UI and selecting, "Demo Workspace" at the bottom of the Help Hub modal.
