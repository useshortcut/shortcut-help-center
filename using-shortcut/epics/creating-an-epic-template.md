# Creating an Epic Template

### Creating an Epic Template

In Shortcut we have [Story Templates](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016736311-Story-Templates-Overview) that allow you to create Stories from a pre-formatted template, saving you and your team time and effort on commonly written Stories. Did you ever want to do the same with Epics? While we currently do not have a specific Epic Template functionality, we do have a workaround that will provide a good starting point.

### Template Set up <a href="#h_01hx0gep24pgmkyjshzwj5f9vh" id="h_01hx0gep24pgmkyjshzwj5f9vh"></a>

**First**, create a Story Template that's a solid base of the information you need. Within the Story Template, add:

* Title
* Description
* Tasks (which will become Stories)
* Task Owners (which will become Story Owners)
* Optional - Due Date for the Story (which will become the Due Date for the Epic)
* Optional - Labels (become Epic Labels)
* Optional - Followers (become Epic Followers)

Once you feel it captures the bulk of what you want, **save** the Story Template as _"Story --> Epic Template"_ for example.

* Whenever you need that particular Epic created with all the Stories (with or without Story Owners), Followers, Labels, etc., create the Story using the respective template.&#x20;

### Story to Epic <a href="#h_01hx0ggvyx3q95s3fy9kpfc2qr" id="h_01hx0ggvyx3q95s3fy9kpfc2qr"></a>

Once a Story is created via the Story Template, select the three dots at the top tight and select **Convert Story to Epic** (as seen below). This will start the process of converting that Story into an Epic and archiving the original Story as a comment on the Epic for posterity. It's not everything, but it's a really great way to get a bunch of information created quickly!

The first comment on an Epic communicates the Epic was converted from a Story (as seen below).

All the Tasks from the Story are converted to Stories that are a part of the Epic (as seen below).

Please note that there are some limitations when performing this conversion (e.g. markdown formatting is not currently supported in Story or Epic Titles - only as part of descriptions and there is a 512-character limit for Story Titles).

This process is still meant to be a workaround and doesn't capture everything, but it's a really great way to get a bunch of information created quickly!
