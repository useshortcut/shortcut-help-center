# Epic Workflow States

You can change an Epic's state from several places in the UI. First, you can navigate to the specific Epic page and select the state from the dropdown in the sidebar:

You can also navigate to the Epics page, and click on the Table view. You can click the state dropdown and update the state directly from the Epics page.

If you use the Epics page "Column" view, any Epics that seem to be done but are still in a started state, you'll see a blue notification banner and button that will move the Epic into a done state.
