# The Epics Page Table View

Although both views will show you the same information about Epics, that information may be displayed differently depending on whether you've selected the Table view or the **Column view**. &#x20;

As its name suggests, the Table view displays your Epics in a tabular format. You can easily sort the Epics in the Table view in ascending or descending order by clicking on any of the titles at the top of the columns seen below:

You can reorder the way the columns are displayed using the Display dropdown. Dragging a column name up will shift it left on the table; dragging a column name down will shift it right on the table.        ![Reorder columns.gif](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/article_attachments/23320620642836)

You can also re-order by Epic priority. Priorities in [Shortcut](https://www.shortcut.com/) are structured vertically, so the higher up in the table the Epic is, the higher its priority. You can change the priority of Epics in Table view by dragging them around:

&#x20;Filtering Epics in the Table view is also easy. You can filter Epics by name Search, Owners, Objectives, Epic States, Labels, and Group by Objective or Workflow State.
