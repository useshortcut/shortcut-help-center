# What are Spaces

### What are Spaces?

### Overview <a href="#h_01j3r7jxemd3jc5bd6nn8371b1" id="h_01j3r7jxemd3jc5bd6nn8371b1"></a>

All views on the Stories page are organized as Spaces. You can create and share Spaces on your "All Work" Stories Page across teams, or on your Team-Scoped Stories page with your teams for views to run Stand-Up, or manage specific projects.&#x20;

A Space can be any combination of Projects, Epics, Workflow States, and keyword filters. Some example Spaces might be: "My Work", "My Squad's Work", or "All Bugs Without Owners".

We provide a few permanent Spaces, which appear with a star instead of a circle. You can only make changes to the Spaces you have created. These are indicated by a personal or shared icon (indicating a Shared Space).

#### Types of Spaces <a href="#h_01j3r7k3y8snpde6cayyj3qd70" id="h_01j3r7k3y8snpde6cayyj3qd70"></a>

Shortcut has created a few default Spaces that are already shared with your workspace (admins can change these spaces to adjust the preferred workflow and filters!):

* All Work: View all Stories associated with the workflow filter selected.
* Owned by Me: View all Stories owned by you, associated with the workflow filter selected.
* Requested by Me: View all Stories you requested, associated with the workflow filter selected.
* Updated in Last Week:  View all Stories updated in the last week, associated with the workflow selected.
* Current Iteration (available on your team-scoped Stories pages): View Stories owned by your team in the current started iteration.
* Bugs and Fixes (available on your team-scoped Stories pages): View Bug Stories owned by your team.
