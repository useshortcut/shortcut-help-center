# Where do I find my shared and hidden Spaces?

All Shared Spaces can be found in the "Spaces" Menu to the left of your Tab List. _**Note: Team-Shared Spaces are only available on that Team's Stories Page. This applies to migrated Spaces from the legacy Stories page.**_&#x20;

If you "x" a Space from your tab list, you can access that Space from the "Spaces Menu". If you want to edit a Space, open the Space - see our Help Center Article on [How to save and update a custom Space](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016008052-How-do-I-save-and-update-a-custom-Space)
