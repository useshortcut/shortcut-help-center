# How do I save and update a custom Space?

### Personal and Shared Spaces <a href="#h_01j3ny05shc9hvb8p85914ckme" id="h_01j3ny05shc9hvb8p85914ckme"></a>

To save changes to a Space, click the drop-down in your active Space Tab. In this drop-down you will have access to options to save or discard your changes. **Saved changes to Shared Spaces will be published to all users in your workspace.** You'll see the Space Owner in the drop-down menu.&#x20;

Note: If you are a Member, you can only edit spaces that you have created.&#x20;

Select "Edit" to share or re-name your Space. When you Create a new Space, or "Save As," you can set the Space name and privacy (personal or shared).

### Team-Scoped Spaces <a href="#h_01j3nvkyhh773jxt1gn3wmp5zf" id="h_01j3nvkyhh773jxt1gn3wmp5zf"></a>

When you create and edit Spaces on Team-Scoped Stories Pages, those Spaces are accessible from that Stories Page. When you save changes to Shared Spaces on the Stories Page, anyone can view that Space on that Team-Scoped Stories Page

### Workflows <a href="#h_01j3nvpa0v40h9h4e2kar1jvx4" id="h_01j3nvpa0v40h9h4e2kar1jvx4"></a>

Now, you can save a workflow to the Space. Once saved, anyone who views that Space (if it is shared) will see that Space with the workflow selected. This can be done for pre-made Spaces from [Shortcut](https://www.shortcut.com/) (only admins can save changes to pre-made Spaces).
