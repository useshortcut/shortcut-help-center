# How can I see how many iterations a story has been in?

[Shortcut](https://vimeo.com/528156269) keeps track of how many previously started Iterations a Story was in. You can view this in two ways: when you hover over a story card Iterations icon, and when inside a Story's dialog.

Hover over a Story card's Iteration icon when on the Stories page to see how many Iterations the Story was previously in:

To see the specific Iteration or Iterations that the Story was previously in, hover over the Iteration metadata field in a Story's dialog :

**Note:**

A "previously started Iteration" for a particular Story is defined as satisfying both of these conditions:

1. The Story was previously in the Iteration for more than a day.
2. When the Story was removed from the Iteration, the Iteration was in the Started state or the Done state.
