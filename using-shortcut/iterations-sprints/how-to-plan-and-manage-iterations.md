Learn how plan and get the most out of Iterations using Docs.

This section gives an overview of the Docs and planning strategies used and recommended by Shortcut to effectively plan Iterations in Shortcut.

#### Team Doc <a href="#h_01hw39qb1yba1y0y3n60wa8m0c" id="h_01hw39qb1yba1y0y3n60wa8m0c"></a>

Each team has an overview Doc that outlines the goals, team members, ceremonies, and key team documentation. This Doc serves as a hub for the team and provides visibility across the company, so anyone can find and understand these core aspects of each team. Within this Doc the key component relevant to Iteration planning is the ceremonies section which shows the schedule of each Iteration and when planning will take place. ![](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6284144cb1a1fee6254fd9f3/63357f6f7acae61f0d131451_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20\(14\).gif)

#### Quarterly Planning Doc <a href="#h_01hw39qb1yjfjpmpgvvzwz99bq" id="h_01hw39qb1yjfjpmpgvvzwz99bq"></a>

The planning Doc is a hub and is broken down by quarter. This is a document outlines the work forecasted for the development cycle and makes it easy for everyone on the team and the organization to view the Iterations the team has completed over the quarter.

This Doc includes:

* Key goals and dates to keep the team and company aligned on what this team is working towards and focused on.
* Linked Iterations next to the dates it took place. This makes it really easy to see progress across the quarter and to access each Iteration.
* Research Docs such as PRDs and SPIKEs that are related to these Iterations. This ensures everything you need is in one place.&#x20;
* Notes Docs where you can link any other related Doc, again so everything is in one place.

#### Iteration planning meeting Doc <a href="#h_01hw39qb1ypgchcsggw89ngmqs" id="h_01hw39qb1ypgchcsggw89ngmqs"></a>

The Sprint/Iteration planning template in Shortcut gives you a great template to use for Iteration planning. To use this template go into Shortcut and Sprint/Iteration planning and start using for your team!\
‍\
Here are a couple of key callouts to get the most out of this template.

* Link Iteration and Doc- Shortcut allows you to create an Iteration directly from the Doc or link an existing Iteration in the Doc. You should also link this Doc to the Iteration itself. That way no matter where you are working you have everything you need.
* Celebrate what is accomplished and be reflective- In the Decide on Realistic Goals section have the team commit to what they would like to accomplish. Laying this out allows for celebration and the team to really take the time to reflect on what they are building and accomplishing. One rule we live by is while goal suggestions can be made by the team goals have to be made and accepted by the owner, they aren’t assigned out from the team.

#### Iteration Refinement <a href="#h_01hw39r5ht7hvab8de5thyart1" id="h_01hw39r5ht7hvab8de5thyart1"></a>

There are some ways to make Iteration refinement easier in Shortcut.

**Story Prioritization**

* Use the Priority Field - The Priority Field allows for easy filtering. It makes it easy to quickly see what items are the highest priority. On an Epic you can use the Field filter to sort by High Priority. On the Stories page you can also use the Priority field to quickly filter for high priority Stories.

* Use the Stories page to drag and drop to prioritize Stories

* A Team Roadmap Doc is a great place to outline what Epics to be pulling from. Creating this prioritized shortlist makes it easy to know what the team's focus is and takes the guesswork out of prioritizing.

**Pulling Stories into an Iteration**

When building out your Iterations there are a couple of views that make it easy to add Stories to your Iteration. Try them all and figure out what works best for you.

* Stories page- Sort the Stories page by Workflow, Epic, and State to see the Stories that can be added to the Iteration. Use the bulk edit feature to add in more than one at a time.
* Epics- Go to the Epic the team is working on and sort by State. Then click to open or edit inline to add the Story to the Iteration.
* Stories drawer- On the Iterations page open the Stories drawer and then sort either by Epic or Workflow and drag and drop the Stories into the Iteration.
