# How do I add a Story to an Iteration from the Story dialog?

Make sure that [Iterations are enabled in your Workspace](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028913112).

When editing an existing Story from the Story dialog, add, remove, or change the Iteration it belongs to in the right side panel. This also applies to when you are creating a Story in the new Story dialog.
