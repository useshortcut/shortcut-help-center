# How do I enable Iterations in my Workspace?

By default, Iterations is disabled in a Workspace.

A Workspace Owner or Admin can enable Iterations by going to the settings gear wheel and then **Workspace Features >  Iterations.**

Once Iterations is enabled in a Workspace, all users in that Workspace will see the Iterations icon in the [navigation bar](https://help.shortcut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028787511) on the left. Users can start creating and using Iterations by clicking on the Iterations icon.

The Iterations icon (and other Iterations UI) will not show up in a Workspace if Iterations is disabled.
