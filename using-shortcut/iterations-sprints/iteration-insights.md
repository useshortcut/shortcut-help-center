# Iteration Insights

Hit your Iteration goals with at-a-glance versions of your Burndown and Cumulative Flow reports to quickly understand how work is progressing, identify bottlenecks in the process, and if you'll meet your commitments.

Use these insights to:

* **View Iteration Progress:** The Burndown chart shows work remaining vs. an ideal pace to finish work on time. This is a quick gauge of iteration status and health.
* **Monitor Flow:** The Cumulative Flow Diagram shows work progressing through workflow states. It's useful for identifying bottlenecks and viewing overall status of work.

Insights are available once the Iteration starts, and are locked in for retrospective after the Iteration ends.&#x20;
